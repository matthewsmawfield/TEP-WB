## Abstract

JWST has revealed a set of high-redshift anomalies that appear disparate in detail but share a common structure: star formation efficiencies exceeding $\Lambda$CDM limits, overmassive black holes, and anomalous stellar-to-dynamical mass ratios all appear preferentially in the deepest gravitational potentials. This work tests whether that common pattern can arise from a single violation of the isochrony axiom. In Temporal Equivalence Principle (TEP), a chameleon-screened scalar-tensor theory, proper time depends on environment in unscreened halos. Using the clock-sector coupling $\alpha_{\rm eff} = (9.6 \pm 4.0) \times 10^5$ mag measured by Paper 11's Cepheid analysis, applied directly to the potential-linear $\Gamma_t$ formula (zero free JWST parameters), the framework fully resolves the Red Monster efficiency excess and provides a physical route to differential black-hole growth in Little Red Dots.


Strongest current direct test is a kinematic comparison using the JWST-SUSPENSE survey of massive quiescent galaxies at $z = 1.2$–$2.3$ ($N = 15$). A fundamental vulnerability of evaluating TEP photometrically is mass-proxy circularity, as $\Gamma_t$ depends on the gravitational potential. By employing dynamically measured masses ($M_{\rm dyn}$) from stellar velocity dispersions and spectral ages derived from absorption features, the SUSPENSE analysis tests a dynamical-potential predictor and photometric stellar mass side by side. The central comparison shows that $\Gamma_t$ predicts spectral age more strongly than stellar mass, yielding $\rho({\rm Age}, \Gamma_t \mid z) = +0.733$ ($p = 1.9 \times 10^{-3}$) compared to $\rho({\rm Age}, M_* \mid z) = +0.493$ ($p = 0.062$). Under joint control of the competing predictor and redshift, $\Gamma_t$ retains a residual association with age, $\rho({\rm Age}, \Gamma_t \mid M_*, z) = +0.624$ ($p = 0.0129$), whereas stellar mass contributes no residual signal once $\Gamma_t$ is controlled, $\rho({\rm Age}, M_* \mid \Gamma_t, z) = -0.036$ ($p = 0.898$). Propagating the published asymmetric uncertainties for all 15 galaxies preserves a positive $\Gamma_t$ residual in 99.7\% of Monte Carlo draws. This one-sided residual structure supports the interpretation that galaxy evolution scales more closely with gravitational potential depth than with baryonic mass alone, and it materially narrows the photometric circularity objection.


Primary large-sample JWST evidence comes from the photometric anomalies that motivated the theory, treated here as two primary empirical lines across three surveys ($N = 4{,}726$). A key model-discriminating result is the Uniformity Paradox: dust and accelerated evolution switch on selectively with potential depth ($\rho = +0.62$ at $z > 8$). Any standard-physics explanation that adjusts a time-uniform ingredient, such as enhanced AGB yields, would predict dust to become broadly ubiquitous or to follow star formation, rather than tracking gravitational depth. The effective-time coordinate organizes this dust signal better than raw cosmic time, passing a dedicated validation battery with $\rho(t_{\rm eff}, A_V \mid t_{\rm cosmic}) = +0.600$ ($p = 5.0 \times 10^{-29}$). Similarly, the mass–sSFR relation at $z > 7$ shows a strong partial correlation with $\Gamma_t$ ($\rho = -0.49$, $p = 10^{-18}$).


The same mapping also relieves the benchmark stellar-mass-function and cosmic-SFRD excesses. Full CAMB Boltzmann integration remains consistent with Planck constraints ($\sigma_8$ within $0.1\sigma$). The combination of the large-sample photometric lines, the direct kinematic comparison, and the structural necessity of the Uniformity Paradox supports TEP as the most coherent presently available explanation for the early-universe anomalies considered here.

## 1. Introduction


### 1.1 Observational Tensions

JWST has revealed a coherent pattern of anomalies at $z > 5$ that strains the standard framework for inferring stellar properties from photometry. The most visible example is the class of spectroscopically confirmed "Red Monsters" (Xiao et al. 2024), whose stellar masses ($M_* \gtrsim 10^{11}\,M_\odot$) imply baryon-to-star conversion efficiencies of $\sim 0.50$, more than double the $\sim 0.20$ theoretical maximum imposed by feedback in $\Lambda$CDM halos. Within the Boylan-Kolchin (2023) framework, the discrepancy reaches $11\sigma$. This tension is not isolated. The UNCOVER UV luminosity function at $z > 9$ implies a star formation rate density exceeding the halo accretion limit by factors of 4–10 (Chemerynska et al. 2024).

A second anomaly appears in the population of "Little Red Dots" (LRDs): compact, red sources hosting broad-line AGN whose supermassive black holes ($M_{\rm BH} \sim 10^7$–$10^8\,M_\odot$) are 10–100 times more massive relative to their hosts than local scaling relations predict ($M_{\rm BH}/M_* \sim 0.1$ vs. $0.001$; Matthee et al. 2024). Growing such objects from stellar seeds requires near-continuous super-Eddington accretion despite their high observed space density ($n \sim 10^{-5}\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-3}$). A third anomaly emerges in JWST NIRSpec kinematics: at $z \gtrsim 3$–4, massive quiescent galaxies show $M_*/M_{\rm dyn} \gtrsim 1$ (Esdaile et al. 2021; Tanaka et al. 2019), while at $z > 5.5$ low-mass star-forming systems show the opposite extreme, with dynamical masses exceeding stellar masses by up to a factor 40 (de Graaff et al. 2024a). Both patterns are inconsistent with standard expectations and together suggest a mass-dependent bias in photometric stellar-mass estimates.

Across these cases, the common structure is the same: stellar masses and ages inferred from photometry appear systematically too large, too early, in precisely the environments with the deepest gravitational potentials.


### 1.2 Challenging Isochrony with TEP

Underlying every photometric inference of stellar age, mass, and star formation rate is the isochrony axiom: the assumption that the clock governing stellar evolution ticks at the universal cosmic rate, regardless of local gravitational environment. Under isochrony, an observed red colour is interpreted as a combination of age, dust, and metallicity, and the resulting mass-to-light ratio ($M/L \propto t^n$) is treated as universal. If this axiom is violated — if stars in deep gravitational potentials accumulate proper time faster than the cosmic mean — then SED-inferred masses and ages are systematically inflated in precisely the environments where JWST finds the largest anomalies.

The Temporal Equivalence Principle (TEP) formalises this possibility within a conformally coupled scalar-tensor framework with chameleon screening (Khoury & Weltman 2004; Brax et al. 2004; Burrage & Sakstein 2018). In unscreened halos, the conformal factor $A(\phi) > 1$ causes stellar clocks to tick faster relative to coordinate time, so that a galaxy's effective age $t_{\rm eff} = \Gamma_t\,t_{\rm cosmic}$ exceeds its cosmic age. The resulting bias in $M/L$ inflates inferred stellar masses by $\Gamma_t^n$, directly mimicking a star formation efficiency excess. This effect is physically distinct from standard gravitational redshift: photons still lose energy climbing out of potential wells (kinematic redshift, fully preserved in TEP), while the scalar field coupling independently accelerates atomic processes within the well. Both effects coexist; only the latter biases photometric mass inference.


**Physics Note: Dilation vs. Enhancement**

It is essential to distinguish between two relativistic effects:


- **Kinematic Gravitational Redshift (Standard GR):** Photons lose energy climbing out of potential wells. This affects light and is fully preserved in TEP.

- **Dynamical Clock Rate (TEP):** The scalar field coupling modifies the effective mass of particles, changing the rate at which atomic clocks tick relative to coordinate time. In the TEP framework, the scalar field in diffuse halos relaxes to values where $A(\phi) > 1$, causing clocks to tick *faster* (enhancement) than the cosmic mean, even while photons suffer redshift.




The TEP enhancement effect is governed by the temporal enhancement factor $\Gamma_t$:


$$\Gamma_t = \exp\left[ K \frac{\Phi - \Phi_{\rm ref}}{c^2} \times \sqrt{1+z} \right]$$


The zero-parameter JWST predictions adopt the external Cepheid prior $\alpha_0 = 0.58 \pm 0.16$, calibrated from local Cepheid observations ($z \approx 0$), and apply it unchanged to the high-redshift universe. The JWST observables are then examined to test whether they recover a mutually consistent coupling internally, yielding conditional concordance values near $\alpha_0 \approx 0.55$ in the high-redshift analyses. These internal recoveries are treated as self-consistency checks rather than as replacement calibrations. No parameters are tuned to the JWST data the model seeks to explain. The structural choices in the $\Gamma_t$ formula — the reference redshift $z_{\rm ref} = 5.5$, reference halo mass $\log M_{h,\rm ref} = 12.0$, exponential functional form, and $\sqrt{1+z}$ coupling scaling — were fixed by the scalar-tensor framework in prior papers (Papers 1 and 7); all have independent physical motivation and none were adjusted to improve JWST fits (§4.11.1).


### 1.3 Reader's Guide to the Evidence

This manuscript is easiest to read as a progression from prediction to population tests to physical interpretation. Because the analysis spans photometric, kinematic, and spatial data across multiple JWST surveys, the evidence is organized explicitly by role rather than presented as a flat list of correlations:


- **Stage 1: The zero-parameter prediction (§3.2).** The local-universe TEP calibration is applied directly to the most extreme $z > 5$ anomalies (the Red Monsters) to test whether it predicts the scale of the star formation efficiency correction without any JWST tuning.

- **Stage 2: Two primary empirical lines, one ancillary spatial indication, one derived regime-level comparison, and one direct kinematic test (§3.0–3.10).** The statistical core of the manuscript is built from three JWST surveys ($N = 4{,}726$), supplemented by a direct JWST-SUSPENSE kinematic comparison. The branches are separated according to evidential weight and independence:

**L1. Dust–$\Gamma_t$ emergence:** At $z > 8$, massive galaxies are dusty while low-mass galaxies remain dust-poor ($\rho = +0.62$). The signal strengthens with redshift and is organized by an AGB-like effective-time threshold. A Fisher combination across the three photometric surveys yields $24.4\sigma$.

- **L2. Inside-out core screening (ancillary spatial indication):** JADES resolved photometry and the preferred DR5 direct-mass morphology sample indicate more centrally screened, bluer-core structures in the more massive systems. Because the direct gradient predictor-comparison and residual tests remain non-significant, this branch is retained as ancillary rather than counted as a primary line.

- **L3. Mass–sSFR inversion:** The standard downsizing correlation reverses sign at $z > 7$, consistent with time-dilation inflating the apparent sSFR in massive early halos. The discontinuous sign change makes this test difficult to mimic with smooth mass-measurement systematics.

- **L4. Dynamical mass comparison (derived regime comparison):** A matched regime-level kinematic comparison indicates that the TEP correction can reconcile anomalously high $M_*/M_{\rm dyn} > 1$ cases using SED-independent kinematics. A supplementary five-object direct literature ingestion at $z = 3.2$–$4.0$, including one conservative upper-limit row, is directionally consistent and materially strengthens the kinematic rebuttal to the photometric mass-proxy objection, but the higher-$z$ regime-level branch remains the authoritative derived comparison rather than a primary empirical line.

- **L5. Direct kinematic test:** The JWST-SUSPENSE comparison directly evaluates $\Gamma_t$ derived from $M_{\rm dyn}$ against photometric $M_*$ in predicting spectral age. It is the strongest current direct test on the mass-circularity objection, but because the sample is still small ($N = 15$) it is carried as a direct kinematic test with an explicit small-sample caveat rather than as one of the two primary large-sample lines.



- **Stage 3: The Little Red Dot mechanism (§4.9).** The framework is then applied to the overmassive black-hole problem, where *differential temporal topology* between the dense core and the diffuse stellar halo provides a route to rapid apparent growth without requiring sustained extreme super-Eddington accretion.




### 1.4 Prior Cross-Domain Evidence for TEP

The JWST analysis presented here is not the first test of the TEP framework. A local Cepheid analysis (Paper 11) provides a clock-sector coupling $\alpha_{\rm eff} = (9.6 \pm 4.0) \times 10^5$ mag from Cepheid period-luminosity residuals, and the present high-redshift study asks whether JWST observables independently recover a consistent coupling across multiple domains spanning 13.5 Gyr of cosmic time (Table 11, §4.2). *Important caveat:* all prior constraints in Table 11 derive from the same author's analysis programme; the TEP series has not yet undergone independent replication or peer review in a refereed journal. Readers should weigh the cross-domain consistency with this single-source limitation in mind (§4.11a). The three domains most directly used in this work are:


- **Hubble Tension:** Stratification of $N = 29$ SH0ES Cepheid hosts by velocity dispersion reveals an environmental bias. High-$\sigma$ hosts yield $H_0 = 72.45 \pm 2.32$ km/s/Mpc; low-$\sigma$ hosts yield $H_0 = 67.82 \pm 1.62$ km/s/Mpc — consistent with Planck within $1\sigma$. The TEP correction with the Paper 11-derived coupling $\alpha_{\rm eff} = (9.6 \pm 4.0) \times 10^5$ mag yields $H_0^{\rm TEP} = 68.66 \pm 1.51$ km/s/Mpc ($0.79\sigma$ from Planck). This provides the low-redshift anchor used in this work.

- **Globular Cluster Pulsars:** Analysis of 380 millisecond pulsars reveals a $0.13$ dex spin-down excess in cluster pulsars ($p = 1.7 \times 10^{-15}$). The environmental screening threshold $\sigma > 165$ km/s derived from this population is used directly in §2.3.2.2 and §4.4.3 of this work.

- **Universal Critical Density:** GNSS atomic clock networks yield $\rho_c \approx 20$ g/cm³, independently confirmed by the SPARC rotation curve slope and magnetar critical periods. This $\rho_c$ is used as the screening threshold in this work.


The central question this work addresses is whether the same Paper 11-derived $\alpha_{\rm eff}$ that resolves the Hubble tension and accounts for pulsar timing anomalies also predicts the high-redshift galaxy anomalies, with no re-tuning. The JWST analysis uses this coupling directly in the potential-linear $\Gamma_t$ formula, converting from the magnitude sector (Cepheid P-L residuals) to the stellar-population sector (nuclear burning timescales) via the shared TEP framework.


### 1.5 Alternative Explanations

There is no shortage of standard-physics explanations for JWST's high-redshift surprises. Proposed mechanisms include top-heavy initial mass functions, bursty or ultra-efficient star formation, early black hole seeding, strong AGN contamination, dust geometry effects, and selection/systematic biases in the spectral-energy-distribution (SED) fitting procedures. The present work does not dismiss these a priori; instead, it evaluates whether they can reproduce the specific temporal and structural signatures in the data.

Standard alternatives include top-heavy initial mass functions (Boylan-Kolchin 2023), enhanced AGN feedback, bursty star formation, and super-Eddington accretion. Each can partially address one or two of the observed anomalies, but not the full set considered here. AGN feedback predicts a negative dust–black hole mass correlation, as AGN activity clears dust; the observed relation is positive ($\rho = +0.62$). Bursty star formation predicts bluer colours during burst phases, whereas the TEP-enhanced population is significantly redder at fixed magnitude ($\rho(M_{\rm mag}, \text{color}) = -0.40$, $p = 2.8 \times 10^{-16}$, $N = 398$). Top-heavy IMFs can partially relieve the star formation efficiency crisis but offer no mechanism for the spatially resolved screening gradients, the mass–sSFR inversion, or the differential black hole growth in Little Red Dots. In the systematic comparison across the live JWST core evidence package (§4.3.5), TEP is the only framework in that comparison that captures both primary empirical lines while remaining directionally consistent with the ancillary L2 indication and the derived L4 regime comparison. No alternative in that comparison reproduces the cross-domain consistency of $\alpha_0$ across instruments, epochs, and physical regimes.


**Key Limitations**

Several important limitations should be borne in mind when evaluating the evidence presented here:


- **Mass circularity and the Kinematic Resolution:** In purely photometric samples, because $\Gamma_t$ is derived from halo mass, distinguishing TEP effects from intrinsic mass-dependent evolution requires careful partial-correlation analysis and exploitation of the independent redshift-dependent component. The current SUSPENSE kinematic comparison materially narrows this objection by testing a dynamical-potential predictor and photometric stellar mass directly against spectral age. Its strongest discriminant is a one-sided residual structure: the dynamical predictor retains significant age information after $M_*$+$z$ control, whereas $M_*$ does not after $\Gamma_t$+$z$ control.

- **Spectroscopic sample size:** Two public spectroscopic compilations substantially improve the earlier small-sample situation. JADES DR4 (D'Eugenio et al. 2025) provides 2,858 good-quality spec-z with 118 at $z > 7$. The DJA NIRSpec Merged Table v4.4 (Brammer et al.; September 2025) provides 19,445 unique grade-$\ge 3$ sources from all public JWST/NIRSpec programs, with 698 at $z > 7$ and 234 at $z > 8$. These compilations materially strengthen the spectroscopic context, although some analysis-specific highest-redshift slices remain small. Stellar masses also still rely on photometric estimates ($\pm 0.3$–$0.5$ dex), so the spectroscopic branches remain supportive consistency checks rather than independent primary lines of evidence. In the main evidence synthesis, the SUSPENSE kinematic comparison provides the strongest direct evidence on the mass-circularity question. The three-survey photometric L1 combination ($24.4\sigma$) and the L3 mass–sSFR inversion provide the two large-sample primary empirical lines, while the dedicated UNCOVER $z > 8$ dust battery and DJA-based GOODS-S / H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ branches are treated as robustness or supplementary checks.

- **Theoretical foundation:** The enhancement factor $\Gamma_t > 1$ is motivated by a scalar-tensor, two-metric construction in which matter couples to a conformal factor $A(\phi)$ and screening suppresses the effective coupling in dense regimes. The first-principles action, field equations, screening mechanism, and PPN consistency mapping provide the foundation for this framework; this manuscript presents only the components required to define and test the observational mapping (§2.3.2). A full joint cosmological parameter inference is outside the scope of this work.

- **Red Monsters case study:** The $N = 3$ illustrative case study is not statistically robust in isolation. Population-level tests ($N = 2{,}315$) provide the primary evidence.




Section 2 defines the TEP mapping, the datasets, and the statistical procedures. Section 3 presents the two primary empirical lines, the direct kinematic decisive test, and then places the ancillary spatial indication, the derived regime-level comparison, and the supplementary replications in their proper evidential order. Section 4 interprets the results in the broader theoretical context, including precision-GR consistency, the link to the Hubble tension, and the Little Red Dot mechanism. Section 5 closes with falsification criteria and observational predictions. Appendix A provides the theoretical foundation (action, field equations, screening mechanism), and Appendix B documents key computational definitions and reference tables.


## 2. Data and Methods


This section follows the same logic as the manuscript as a whole. It
first defines the observational datasets, then the derived TEP
quantities, then the statistical tests used to separate genuine TEP
signatures from mass-proxy artifacts, and finally the black-hole
simulation used for the Little Red Dot mechanism. The aim is to state
the observational mapping clearly enough that each empirical result in
§3 can be read directly back to its data and assumptions.



### 2.1 Data


#### 2.1.1 Red Monsters (FRESCO)


The motivating case study is the class of ultra-massive galaxies at $z
\sim 5$–$6$ exemplified by the three spectroscopically confirmed "Red
Monsters" reported by Xiao et al. (2024). For the illustrative TEP
prediction (§3.1), representative parameters spanning the published
range ($z \approx 5.3$–$5.9$, $\log M_* \approx 10.8$–$11.2$, SFE
$\approx 0.50$) are adopted. These capture the regime where the anomaly
is most acute. The resulting SFE correction fully resolves the anomaly
(corrected SFE $\sim 0.11$, well below the $\Lambda$CDM limit of 0.20),
with the correction depending primarily on $\Gamma_t$ (set by halo mass
and redshift via the pre-calibrated TEP formula) and insensitive to the
precise input SFE at the $\lesssim 2\%$ level.



#### 2.1.2 UNCOVER DR4


For population-level tests, the UNCOVER DR4 stellar population synthesis
catalog is used (Wang et al. 2024; Furtak et al. 2023). The analysis
applies quality cuts and constructs a high-redshift sample with $4 <
z < 10$ and $\log M_* > 8$, yielding $N = 2{,}315$ galaxies. For
multi-property analyses (age ratio, metallicity, dust), a subset with
complete measurements is used (e.g., $N = 1{,}108$ for the
partial-correlation and split tests).



#### 2.1.3 Independent replications and spectroscopic validation


To evaluate independent replication of the $z > 8$ dust result,
catalogs for CEERS are used (Cox et al. 2025; Finkelstein et al. 2023;
photometric redshifts via EAZY, Brammer et al. 2008) and COSMOS-Web
(Shuntov et al. 2025). The COSMOS2025 catalog (Shuntov et al. 2025)
provides LePHARE SED-derived stellar masses, SFRs, E(B-V) dust, and ages
for 784,016 galaxies over 0.54 deg², with 37,965 sources at $z > 4$
passing quality cuts — the largest high-$z$ photometric SED sample used
in this analysis. The UNCOVER DR4 SPS catalog (Wang et al. 2024; Suess
et al. 2024; Price et al. 2025) uses 20-band MegaScience photometry and
Prospector-β SED fitting, providing 2,628 sources at $z > 4$ with
Prospector dust2 and a spec-z sub-catalog of 203 sources with
spectroscopic redshifts fixed in the SED fit. For spectroscopic
validation, two complementary catalogs are used:



**JADES Data Release 4** (D'Eugenio et al. 2025;
Curtis-Lake et al. 2025; Scholtz et al. 2025): 2,858 high-quality
spectroscopic redshifts (flags A/B) across GOODS-N and GOODS-S, with 118
sources at $z > 7$ and 41 at $z > 8$. UV-luminosity-based stellar
masses (Song et al. 2016) are derived for the 1,345 sources with valid
$M_{\rm UV}$.



**DAWN JWST Archive (DJA) NIRSpec Merged Table v4.4**
(Brammer et al.; de Graaff et al. 2024a; Heintz et al. 2023; September
2025): a comprehensive compilation of 80,367 uniformly reduced
JWST/NIRSpec spectra from all public programs, processed with the
msaexp/grizli reductions. After applying grade $\ge 3$ quality cuts and
deduplication by sky position, 19,445 unique sources are retained, of
which 3,251 are at $z > 5$, 698 at $z > 7$, and 234 at $z > 8$.
Photometric stellar masses are available for 2,598 of the high-$z$
sources. This catalog spans JADES, CEERS, RUBIES, UNCOVER, GLASS,
PRIMER, and more than 50 other public programs, providing the largest
uniform cross-survey spectroscopic sample to date.



#### 2.1.4 MIRI-based mass calibration context


Recent JWST/MIRI analyses (Pérez-González et al. 2024) show that
NIRCam-only SED fits can overestimate stellar masses at $z > 5$
because of age-attenuation degeneracy and emission-line contamination.
When MIRI photometry is included, the number density of the most massive
systems decreases and some candidates are reclassified as dusty or
line-dominated sources. The photometry is not reprocessed in this work,
but published masses are treated as conservative upper bounds and
MIRI-based studies serve as an external check on the interpretation of
the extreme-mass tail.

Related MIRI-supported analyses of Little Red Dots (LRDs) at $z > 4$
find that inferred stellar masses can shift by up to orders of magnitude
depending on the assumed AGN contribution. This motivates a conservative
stance in the interpretation of compact red sources and provides a
systematic-control context for any extreme-mass claims in the
literature.



### 2.2 Key Terminology

The following terms are used consistently throughout this work:




Table 1b: Glossary of Key Terms

| Term | Symbol | Definition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Temporal Enhancement Factor | $\Gamma_t$ | The ratio of effective proper time to cosmic time experienced by stellar populations. In unscreened regions (low density), $\Gamma_t$ increases with potential depth: massive halos have $\Gamma_t > 1$ (enhancement), low-mass halos have $\Gamma_t < 1$ (suppression). In screened regions (density $> \rho_c$), $\Gamma_t \to 1$ regardless of potential depth. |
| Temporal Shear | — | The spatial gradient of the scalar time field $\phi$ ($\nabla\phi$). High ambient matter density flattens this gradient, suppressing the effective coupling continuously rather than at a discrete boundary. Observationally proxied by gradients in $\Gamma_t$ across a galaxy or environment. |
| Isochrony Bias | — | The systematic error in inferred stellar properties (mass, age, SFR) arising from the assumption that stellar clocks tick at the cosmic rate everywhere. Under TEP, this assumption is violated in deep potential wells. |
| Screening | — | The suppression of TEP effects in regions where the local density exceeds a critical threshold ($\rho_c \approx 20$ g/cm³), restoring standard GR physics. Two types are distinguished: *Core Screening*—Screening within a single galaxy, where the deep central potential suppresses TEP ($\Gamma_t \to 1$) while the outskirts remain enhanced. Produces bluer cores and redder outskirts. *Environmental Screening*—Screening by the ambient group or cluster potential, causing galaxies in dense environments to appear younger than isolated field galaxies of the same mass. |
| Effective Time | $t_{\rm eff}$ | The proper time experienced by stellar populations: $t_{\rm eff} = t_{\rm cosmic} \times \Gamma_t$. |




### 2.3 Derived quantities


#### 2.3.1 Halo mass proxy


For each galaxy, the analysis uses an abundance-matching relation
(Behroozi et al. 2019) to map stellar mass to halo mass. This mapping is
used solely to construct the potential proxy $\Phi$ for the TEP parameterization.
To mitigate circularity, sensitivity tests are performed with $\pm 0.3$
dex scatter in the $M_h-M_*$ relation, propagating to $\pm 12\%$ in
$\Gamma_t$ corrections.



#### 2.3.2 The TEP Metric Coupling


The temporal enhancement factor $\Gamma_t$ is not introduced here as an
ad hoc fitting function. It is the observable mapping of a conformally
coupled scalar-tensor framework in which the scalar time field
modifies the local rate at which material clocks accumulate proper time. The full
theoretical development is extensive; this section states only the steps
needed to connect the action-level construction to the measurable
quantities used in the present analysis.



##### 2.3.2.1 From Action to Observable


The TEP framework builds upon scalar-tensor theories with
density-dependent screening (Khoury & Weltman 2004; Brax et al. 2004;
Burrage & Sakstein 2018), extending them via the v0.7 Temporal Topology
mechanism where field gradient flattening (Temporal Shear) provides
continuous geometric screening. The key steps mapping the fundamental physics to the
observable $\Gamma_t$ are:



- 
**Action:** Matter couples to $\tilde{g}_{\mu\nu} =
A(\phi) g_{\mu\nu}$ where $A(\phi) = \exp(2\beta\phi/M_{\rm Pl})$.
The Klein-Gordon equation sources $\phi$ from the matter density

##### 2.3.2.1b Cross-Sector Coupling: From Cepheids to Stellar Populations


The TEP framework provides a unified description of clock-sector physics across 
different astrophysical environments. Paper 11 measures the clock-sector coupling 
from Cepheid period-luminosity residuals: $\alpha_{\rm eff} = (9.6 \pm 4.0) \times 10^5$ mag. 
This section describes how the JWST analysis applies this same coupling to stellar 
populations via the potential-linear $\Gamma_t$ formula.



**Step 1: Cepheid clock-sector coupling (Paper 11).**
For Cepheid pulsation in the TEP framework, the observed period contracts as:
$P_{\rm obs} = P_{\rm true}(1 - |\Phi|/c^2)^{\eta_{\rm clock}}$.
Propagating through the period-luminosity relation with slope $b \approx -3.26$:



$$\Delta M = b\,\log_{10}(P_{\rm obs}/P_{\rm true}) \approx -\frac{b\,\eta_{\rm clock}\,k_{\rm virial}\,\sigma^2}{c^2\ln 10}$$


where $k_{\rm virial} = 3/2$ relates $|\Phi| = k_{\rm virial}\sigma^2$ for an isothermal sphere.
Paper 11 measures the effective magnitude-sector coupling:



$$\alpha_{\rm eff} = \frac{|b|\,\eta_{\rm clock}\,k_{\rm virial}}{\ln 10} = (9.6 \pm 4.0) \times 10^5 \text{ mag}$$


**Step 2: Potential-linear mapping to stellar populations.**
The JWST analysis uses the same clock-sector coupling in a potential-linear formula 
for stellar-population ages. Nuclear burning rates depend on proper time as 
$t_{\rm nuclear} \propto A(\Phi)^{-\alpha_{\rm nuclear}/2}$ where $\alpha_{\rm nuclear} \approx n \approx 0.7$ 
from stellar isochrones ($M/L \propto t^n$). The $\Gamma_t$ formula converts the 
magnitude-sector coupling to the stellar-population sector:



$$K = \frac{\alpha_{\rm eff} \times \ln(10)}{2.5 \times n} \approx 1.26 \times 10^6$$


where the factor 2.5 arises from the conversion between magnitude differences and 
flux ratios ($\Delta m = -2.5\log_{10}(F_2/F_1)$), and $n = 0.7$ is the stellar 
evolution index. This gives the potential-linear $\Gamma_t$:



$$\Gamma_t = \exp\left[ K \times (\Phi_0 - \Phi_{\rm ref,0}) \times \sqrt{1+z} \right]$$


**This is a zero-free-parameter cross-sector application.** The JWST 
analysis uses the Paper 11 coupling $\alpha_{\rm eff} = (9.6 \pm 4.0) \times 10^5$ mag 
directly, with uncertainty propagated through the formula. The legacy value 
$\alpha_0 = 0.58$ is retained for backward compatibility but represents the same 
underlying physics expressed in different units.



$$K = \frac{\alpha_{\rm eff} \times \ln(10)}{2.5 \times n} \approx 1.26 \times 10^6, \quad \Phi_0 = 1.6\times10^{-7} \times \left(\frac{M_h}{10^{12} M_\odot}\right)^{2/3}$$


where $\Phi_{\rm ref,0} = 3.4\times10^{-8}$ corresponds to a $\sim10^{11} M_\odot$ halo at $z=0$,
$n = 0.7$ is the stellar evolution index from $M/L \propto t^n$, and the $\sqrt{1+z}$ factor
accounts for background field evolution (Paper 0). In the mass-proxy form used for halo-based
calculations: $\log M_{h,\rm ref}(z) = 12.0 - 1.5\log_{10}(1+z)$ defines the reference potential
at each redshift, with $z_{\rm ref} = 5.5$.



##### 2.3.2.1a Enhancement and Suppression: The Two-Sided Prediction


The exponential formula predicts two physically distinct regimes
depending on halo mass relative to the redshift-dependent reference mass
$\log M_{h,\rm ref}(z)$:



- 
**Enhancement ($\Gamma_t > 1$, massive halos):** For
$M_h > M_{\rm ref}$, $\Delta\log M_h > 0$ and $\Gamma_t > 1$. The
scalar field $\phi$ is sourced more strongly by the deeper
potential, raising $A(\phi) > 1$ and accelerating material clock
rates relative to the cosmic mean. This is the regime of the Red
Monsters and massive $z > 8$ galaxies.


- 
**Suppression ($\Gamma_t < 1$, low-mass halos):** For
$M_h < M_{\rm ref}$, $\Delta\log M_h < 0$ and $\Gamma_t < 1$. In
shallow potentials, the scalar time field relaxes toward a
lower-energy minimum with $A(\phi) < 1$, meaning material clocks
tick *slower* than the cosmic mean. This is not an ad-hoc
extension: it follows directly from the same conformal coupling
$d\tau/dt \propto A(\phi)^{1/2}$, which is symmetric about the
reference environment. The reference mass $\log M_{h,\rm ref}(z) =
12.0 - 1.5\log_{10}(1+z)$ defines the environment where $A(\phi) =
1$ (i.e., $\phi = 0$ in the Einstein frame), and deviations in
either direction produce proportional clock-rate shifts.




This two-sided prediction is central to the interpretation: the
"Uniformity Paradox" — why low-mass galaxies at $z > 8$ are dust-poor
despite cosmic time being nominally sufficient for AGB production — is
resolved because $\Gamma_t \ll 1$ in low-mass halos shuts off the
effective AGB clock. A model that only predicted enhancement ($\Gamma_t
\geq 1$ everywhere) would not explain the dust-poor low-mass population.
The suppression regime is therefore a falsifiable prediction rather than
a free parameter: it predicts that low-mass galaxies at $z > 8$ should
be systematically younger in their stellar populations than their cosmic
age implies, and should lack dust regardless of the available cosmic
time.



##### 2.3.2.2 Screening and Scale Separation

For a representative concordance-scale coupling $\alpha_0 = 0.57$, the bare
Brans-Dicke parameter is $\omega_{\rm BD} = 1/(2\alpha_0^2) - 1/2 \approx
1.04$ — roughly four orders of magnitude below the Cassini bound
($\omega_{\rm BD} > 40{,}000$; Bertotti et al. 2003). This large
pre-screening discrepancy illustrates the central logic of the TEP
framework: the bare coupling is strong, but in dense environments the scalar
field gradient (Temporal Shear) flattens continuously, suppressing the
effective coupling to $\alpha_{\rm eff} \ll \alpha_0$ and yielding
$\omega_{\rm BD}^{\rm eff} > 10^6$. On cosmological scales, the Compton
wavelength $\lambda_C \sim 1$ Mpc yields Yukawa suppression $\beta_{\rm
eff}(R_8) \approx 0.002$ on $\sigma_8$ scales—well below the Planck bound.
Within individual halos ($r \lesssim 50$ kpc), the field tracks the local
potential and operates locally. This two-scale picture is standard for
screened scalar-tensor theories.
The screening condition for local tests is:


$$\rho > \rho_c \approx 20 \text{ g/cm}^3 \quad \Rightarrow \quad
\Gamma_t \to 1 \text{ (screened)}$$


This critical density is derived independently from three sources that
converge on the same value: GNSS atomic clock networks ($L_c \approx
4200$ km for Earth's mass), atomic physics (soliton radius $R_{\rm
sol}(m_p) \sim a_0$ at the proton mass scale), and magnetar
anti-glitches ($P_{\rm crit} \approx 6.8$ s for 1E 2259+586, 4% match).
The convergence across 40 orders of magnitude in mass provides an
independent consistency check on this screening scale.


At galactic scales, an effective kinematic screening threshold emerges from
analysis of 380 millisecond pulsars in globular clusters, which reveals that
the TEP spin-down excess saturates for systems with velocity dispersion
$\sigma \gtrsim 165$ km/s, consistent with the scalar field gradient
flattening as potential depth increases. This threshold is used in §4.4.3 to
define the environmental screening boundary for JWST galaxies: halos with
$\sigma \gtrsim 165$ km/s (corresponding to $\log M_h \gtrsim 13.5$ at $z
\sim 0$) are expected to be partially screened, suppressing $\Gamma_t$ below
the unscreened prediction.


##### 2.3.2.3 Enhancement vs. Dilation


Standard GR predicts time *dilation* in deep potentials; TEP
predicts *enhancement* ($\Gamma_t > 1$). These refer to different
metrics: gravitational redshift is governed by $g_{\mu\nu}$ (preserved
identically), while material clock rates are governed by
$\tilde{g}_{\mu\nu} = A(\phi)g_{\mu\nu}$. The key distinction is that
$\Gamma_t$ compares clock rates between
*different environments at the same epoch*, not between positions
in a single well. Numerical integration confirms $A(\phi) > 1$ in
unscreened halos for $2\beta^2 > 1$. Solar System bodies are fully
screened ($\Gamma_t \to 1$).





Table 2: TEP Model Parameters (Fixed)

| Parameter | Value | Source | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| $\alpha_{\rm eff}$ (clock-sector) | $(9.6 \pm 4.0) \times 10^5$ mag | Cepheid distance-ladder (Paper 11) | Effective clock-sector coupling from continuous screening analysis ($\sigma^2/c^2$ form) |
| $\beta$ (fundamental) | $\approx 2.3 \times 10^5$ | Derived from $\alpha_{\rm eff}$ via TEP action | Fundamental conformal coupling $\beta$ in $A(\phi) = e^{\beta\phi/M_{\rm Pl}}$ |
| $\alpha_{\rm eff}$ (Paper 11) | $(9.6 \pm 4.0) \times 10^5$ mag | Cepheid period-luminosity residuals | Clock-sector coupling; applied directly to potential-linear $\Gamma_t$ formula |
| $\alpha_0$ (legacy) | $0.58$ | Backward compatibility | Legacy dimensionless coupling; maps to $\alpha_{\rm eff}$ via $(\alpha_0/0.58) \times 9.6\times10^5$ |
| $z_{\rm ref}$ | 5.5 | TEP-H0 | Reference redshift for calibration |
| $\log M_{h, \rm ref}$ | 12.0 | TEP-COS | Reference halo mass at $z=0$ ($\Gamma_t=1$) |

![TEP Metric Coupling Gamma_t as a function of halo mass and redshift](public/figures/figure_1_tep_model.png)




Figure 1: The TEP Metric Coupling $\Gamma_t(M_h, z)$ in the
unscreened regime. The enhancement factor increases with halo mass
(potential depth) and redshift (weakening of cosmological
screening). The reference mass ($\log M_h = 12$) defines $\Gamma_t =
1$ (cosmic time flow). Massive halos at high redshift experience
significant temporal enhancement ($\Gamma_t > 1$), while low-mass
halos are suppressed ($\Gamma_t < 1$). In screened regions
(density $> \rho_c \approx 20$ g/cm³), $\Gamma_t \to 1$ regardless
of mass.





The zero-parameter JWST prediction adopts the derived coupling
$\alpha_0 = 0.58$ (predicted from Paper 11's clock-sector coupling via physical conversion) together with the fixed reference choice
$z_{\rm ref} = 5.5$. The high-redshift concordance analyses later
recover values near $\alpha_0 \approx 0.55$, but those internal
recoveries are treated as consistency checks rather than as the input
calibration. This leaves zero parameters tuned to the JWST data.



##### 2.3.2.7 Cosmological Viability Summary


The TEP framework has been checked against three classes of precision
cosmological constraints:



- 
**BBN:** During the radiation era, $T^\mu_\mu \approx
0$ for relativistic species, so the scalar field driving force
vanishes and $\phi$ remains frozen. Numerical integration yields
$|\Delta H/H|_{\rm max} = 1.7 \times 10^{-13}$ and $\Delta Y_p <
10^{-14}$—shifts $\sim 10^{12}$ times below observational
uncertainties (Appendix A.1.6).


- 
**Linear growth ($\sigma_8$):** Yukawa suppression on
$\gtrsim 10$ Mpc scales reduces the effective coupling to
$\beta_{\rm eff} \lesssim 0.002$, preserving $\Lambda$CDM-consistent
$\sigma_8$ (§2.3.2.2; Appendix A.1.7–A.1.8).


- 
**Solar System (PPN):** Temporal Shear suppression in
dense environments reduces the effective coupling to $\alpha_{\rm
eff} \ll \alpha_0$ for solar-system bodies, satisfying Cassini and
lunar laser ranging bounds (Appendix A.1.3).




**Scale-dependent growth computation:** To go beyond the
analytic Yukawa argument, the linear growth ODE is solved independently
for each Fourier mode $k$, incorporating the full scale-dependent
gravitational coupling $G_{\rm eff}(k,z)/G_N = 1 + 2\beta^2 k^2/(k^2 +
m_\phi(z)^2)$, where $m_\phi(z) = m_{\phi,0}(1+z)^{9/4}$ for $n=1$
potential (standard chameleon form). The resulting matter power spectrum ratio $P_{\rm
TEP}(k)/P_{\Lambda{\rm CDM}}(k)$ and integrated $\sigma_8$ are computed
self-consistently (Appendix A.1.8). Key results:



- 
Planck consistency requires $m_{\phi,0} \gtrsim 0.2\,h$/Mpc
($\lambda_C \lesssim 31\,h^{-1}$ Mpc at $z=0$; Appendix A.1.8).


- 
For typical Temporal Shear parameters, $\beta_{\rm eff}$ on $R_8$ scales
is $\approx 0.0046$—a factor $\sim 126$ below the bare coupling
($G_{\rm eff}/G_N - 1 = 4.1 \times 10^{-5}$ at $k_8$; Appendix
A.1.8).


- 
The predicted $\sigma_8^{\rm TEP} = 0.8110$ vs.
$\sigma_8^{\Lambda{\rm CDM}} = 0.811$; $\Delta\sigma_8 = 7.2 \times
10^{-8}$ ($1.2 \times 10^{-5}\sigma$). RSD: $\Delta\chi^2 = 8 \times
10^{-5}$ across 8 data points (Appendix A.1.8).




This k-dependent growth calculation substantially strengthens the
viability argument beyond the earlier analytic estimate. A full CAMB
Boltzmann integration (Appendix A.1.8.8) confirms these results: at the
fiducial $m_{\phi,0} = 1.0\,h$/Mpc, the CAMB-computed $\sigma_8^{\rm
TEP} = 0.8116$ ($0.10\sigma$ from Planck), with CMB TT deviations $<
0.02\%$ at all $\ell < 2500$ and $\chi^2/{\rm dof} \ll 1$ against
Planck error bars. Planck consistency holds for $m_{\phi,0} \gtrsim
0.2\,h$/Mpc. The CAMB integration uses the scale-dependent growth
equation with Yukawa-suppressed $G_{\rm eff}(k,z)$ and CAMB's exact
lensed CMB spectra, substantially narrowing the remaining theoretical
gap. The remaining approximation — that the scalar field does not modify
acoustic peaks at $z > 1089$ — is justified by $T^\mu_\mu \approx 0$
during radiation domination. A natively coupled hi_class integration
remains desirable for completeness but is no longer expected to change
the conclusion.



#### 2.3.3 Effective time and isochrony bias correction


An effective time is defined as $t_{\rm eff} = t_{\rm
cosmic}\,\Gamma_t$, where $t_{\rm cosmic}$ is computed from a fiducial
cosmology (Planck18). Under the isochrony-bias model used here, the
mass-to-light ratio is assumed to scale as $M/L \propto t^n$ (following
standard SSP predictions; Bruzual & Charlot 2003; Conroy et al.
2009). Forward-modeling analysis finds that $n \approx 0.5$ minimizes
the residual mass-age correlation at $z > 6$, while $n \approx 0.9$ is
preferred at $z = 4$–$6$. For the primary high-$z$ analysis, $n = 0.5$
is adopted. The corrected stellar mass and SFE are:



$$M_{*,\rm true} = M_{*,\rm obs}/\Gamma_t^{n}, \quad \mathrm{SFE}_{\rm
true} = \mathrm{SFE}_{\rm obs}/\Gamma_t^{n}.$$



### 2.4 Statistical procedures


The statistical design separates three questions: whether the predicted
associations are present, whether they survive control for obvious
confounders, and whether they generalize across surveys and subsamples.
Associations are quantified using Spearman rank correlations and
bootstrap confidence intervals. To address confounding by redshift and
stellar mass, partial-correlation analyses implemented via
residualization are employed. In addition to correlation-based tests,
the following are reported:



- 
Stratified comparisons (e.g., high vs low $\Gamma_t$ splits) for
multi-property coherence


- 
Distributional comparisons (e.g., Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests) for
regime separation


- 
Model comparison using both AIC/BIC and nested Bayesian evidence:
the regression comparisons test predictors {z}, {z, $\log M_*$}, {z,
$\Gamma_t$}, and {z, $\log M_*$, $\Gamma_t$}, while a separate
`dynesty` nested-sampling analysis compares TEP against
explicit bursty-SF, varying-IMF, standard-physics, and AGN
alternatives in both raw standardized space and a
mass+$z$-residualized control space





#### 2.4.1 Combined significance and multiple testing


Combined significance is assessed using Fisher's method, Bonferroni
correction, Brown's method (dependence-adjusted), harmonic mean p-value,
and Benjamini-Hochberg FDR ($\alpha = 0.05$). Because omnibus
significance depends sensitively on how clustering and shared predictors
are penalized, the manuscript treats the three-survey photometric L1
replication as the headline result and uses broader multi-test
combinations as supportive context. An extreme stress test that reduces
effective sample sizes by 90% via spatial clustering autocorrelation
still leaves a Bonferroni-corrected floor of $3.3\sigma$ for the mixed
battery. Parametric p-values are supplemented by permutation tests ($N =
10{,}000$ shuffles) and bootstrap confidence intervals ($N = 10{,}000$
resamples). Cross-survey effect sizes are combined via DerSimonian-Laird
random-effects meta-analysis with $I^2$ heterogeneity assessment and
leave-one-out influence diagnostics.



#### 2.4.2 Blind validation protocol


Three split strategies test generalization: (1) time-split (low-$z$
train / high-$z$ test, 60/40); (2) field-split (RA median); (3)
cross-survey leave-one-out. A test passes if the dust–$\Gamma_t$
correlation remains significant ($p < 0.05$) on held-out data.



#### 2.4.3 Stellar-to-halo mass mapping and sensitivity


Each galaxy's stellar mass is mapped to halo mass via abundance matching
($\log M_h \approx \log M_* + 2.0$). Key results survive $\pm 0.5$ dex
perturbations. To test robustness against MIRI-based mass recalibration
(Pérez-González et al. 2024), mass reductions of 0.0–1.0 dex are
applied; TEP signatures persist at $> 4\sigma$ under a 0.5 dex
reduction. At $z > 8$, selection bias toward bright galaxies is
quantified via Monte Carlo completeness weighting ($N = 1{,}000$
iterations) and Savage-Dickey Bayes Factors.



#### 2.4.4 Forward-modeling validation


The $M/L \propto t^{n}$ scaling is validated by varying $n = 0.5$–$0.9$
and identifying the value minimizing the residual mass-age correlation.
At $z > 6$, $n \approx 0.5$ is preferred (consistent with
low-metallicity SSP models); at $z = 4$–$6$, $n \approx 0.9$.



### 2.5 Black Hole Growth Simulation


To test the "Little Red Dot" resolution, a differential temporal topology
simulation was developed. A compact galaxy ($r_e \approx 150$ pc) with a
baryon-dominated core ($c=10$) is modeled. The local temporal
enhancement factor $\Gamma_t(r)$ is computed at the center (Black Hole
environment) and at the effective radius (Stellar environment) across
the redshift range $z=4$–$10$.


The differential growth factor is computed as:


$$\text{Boost} = \exp\left(\frac{\int (\Gamma_{\rm cen}(z) - \Gamma_{\rm
halo}(z)) \, dt_{\rm cosmic}}{t_{\rm Salpeter}}\right)$$


where $t_{\rm Salpeter} \approx 45$ Myr is the Salpeter timescale
(e-folding time for Eddington-limited accretion). This simulation uses
the same fiducial $\alpha_0 \approx 0.55$ scale implied by the external
Cepheid prior, with no additional tuning.



### 2.6 Reproducibility


All analyses are reproducible from the public repository. An end-to-end
run regenerates the manuscript tables, figures, and archived outputs;
execution instructions are provided in the repository README.



## 3. Results


### 3.0 Evidence Summary

The results are organized by evidential role. Two branches are counted as primary empirical lines: L1, the dust–$\Gamma_t$ relation together with the AGB-threshold test, and L3, the mass–sSFR inversion. L2 remains an ancillary spatial indication: it is materially strengthened by the preferred JADES DR5 direct-mass morphology sample, but the direct gradient discriminator is still not decisive. L4 remains a derived regime-level comparison anchored by kinematic information rather than by photometric evidence alone; the new five-object supplementary object-level branch materially strengthens the kinematic rebuttal to the mass-proxy objection without yet promoting L4 to a primary line.

*Independence disclosure:* L1 (dust–$\Gamma_t$ correlation) and the AGB threshold test share the same predictor because $t_{\rm eff}$ is a deterministic function of $\Gamma_t$. Their predictor residual after controlling for $\Gamma_t$ is only $\rho = 0.049$ ($p = 0.41$), so they are counted as one empirical line expressed in two complementary ways. Cross-survey generalization (formerly L5) therefore remains a robustness check on L1, not a new line, and the age-coherence and metallicity branches are not counted because they vanish under joint mass+redshift control.

Several additional branches remain informative but are not promoted in the evidence count. Environmental screening is mixed: the full-sample field-versus-dense split is suggestive, but the targeted $z > 8$ contrast is null ($\Delta\rho = 0.003$, $p = 0.97$), and the rebuilt DJA/JADES protocluster companion on real DJA root fields is likewise mixed/null ($\Delta_{\rm dense-field}=+0.086$, 95% CI $[-0.019,+0.188]$). The screened DJA pilot attached to L4 is directionally supportive — within the quality-screened subset, the Balmer dust proxy tracks fitted emission-line width more strongly than photometric stellar mass after mass+$z$ control ($\rho_{\rm partial}=+0.887$, $p=0.045$, $N=7$), while the competing mass-given-$\sigma$ partial is weak and negative — but because the pilot still relies on grating-fallback instrumental resolution rather than per-pixel $R$, it is retained as supportive context rather than as a standalone counted line.

Dynamical mass comparison** | The matched RUBIES-like regime-level comparison remains the live quantitative anchor; a supplementary five-object direct literature ingestion (Esdaile et al. 2021; Tanaka et al. 2019), including one conservative upper-limit row, gives mean observed excess $0.168$ dex and mean corrected excess $-0.075$ dex on the four-object exact-$M_{\rm dyn}$ subset, resolves 2/3 anomalous exact objects after TEP, and yields a provisional downstream debias bootstrap $\beta = 0.52$ [$0.30$, $1.01$]. A screened DJA pilot spectroscopic-width companion is also directionally supportive: after mass+$z$ control, $\log({\rm H}\alpha/{\rm H}\beta)$ tracks fitted $\sigma$ with partial $\rho = +0.887$ ($p = 0.045$, $N = 7$), while the competing mass-given-$\sigma$ partial is weak and negative; this remains pilot-quality because the public spectra use grating-fallback rather than per-pixel resolution. | ✔ | ✔ | **Derived regime comparison — not counted with primary empirical lines** |

A sigma-only kinematic expansion ($N = 83$, six surveys, $z = 1.2$–$7.6$) breaks the mass-proxy circularity: the TEP-specific $\Gamma_t(\sigma)$ adds significant predictive power for $M_{*,\rm obs}$ beyond $\sigma$ and $z$ individually (partial $\rho = +0.326$, $p = 0.0026$; $z \geq 4$ subset: $\rho = +0.326$, $p = 0.014$, $N = 56$).

### 3.1 Red Monsters: A Zero-Parameter Prediction

The TEP parameterization is applied to galaxies in the Red Monster regime ($z \sim 5$–$6$, $\log M_* \gtrsim 10.5$; Xiao et al. 2024). This is a blind prediction: the external Cepheid prior $\alpha_0 = 0.58 \pm 0.16$ is fixed entirely from local Cepheid data ($z \approx 0$) before the high-redshift fit. The later high-redshift concordance analyses recover values near $\alpha_0 \approx 0.55$, but these are internal consistency checks rather than the input prior. No parameters are fitted or tuned to the high-redshift observations. The three entries below (S1–S3) use representative parameters spanning the published range (§2.1.1); the predicted correction depends primarily on $\Gamma_t$ and is insensitive to the exact input SFE.

Because the sample contains only three objects, the Red Monster calculation is best read as an illustrative zero-parameter case study rather than as a standalone statistical test. The primary statistical weight comes from the population-level analyses ($N = 2{,}315$), and the externally calibrated prediction is further checked across three surveys ($N = 1{,}283$ at $z > 8$).




Table 3b: Illustrative TEP Predictions for Red Monster–Class Galaxies

| ID | $z$ | $\alpha(z)$ | $\Gamma_t$ (Predicted) | SFE$_{\rm obs}$ | SFE$_{\rm true}$ | % Anomaly Resolved |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| S1 | 5.85 | 1.52 | 12.98 | 0.50 | 0.08 | 100% |
| S2 | 5.30 | 1.46 | 7.55 | 0.50 | 0.12 | 100% |
| S3 | 5.55 | 1.48 | 7.53 | 0.50 | 0.12 | 100% |
| Average Prediction | 9.35 | 0.50 | 0.11 | 100% |  |  |



The predicted mass bias $\Gamma_t^{n} \approx 4.7$ reduces the corrected SFE to $\sim 0.11$ (well below the standard $\Lambda$CDM limit of 0.20). The anomaly is fully resolved for all three objects. Propagating the external Cepheid prior (Paper 11, $\alpha_{\rm eff} = (9.6 \pm 4.0) \times 10^5$ mag) uncertainty confirms robustness: even at the lower $1\sigma$ bound ($\alpha_{\rm eff} = 5.6 \times 10^5$ mag), the corrected SFE remains well below 0.20 and the anomaly is still fully resolved with zero tuned parameters.


### 3.3 UNCOVER DR4: Mass-sSFR and Mass-Age Correlations

The Red Monster case study establishes that TEP predicts the correct direction and magnitude of the SFE correction for individual extreme objects. The critical question is whether this signal extends to the full galaxy population. In the UNCOVER DR4 sample ($N = 2{,}315$), the mass-sSFR correlation is weak but significant ($\rho = -0.13$, $p = 1.3 \times 10^{-10}$, Cohen's $d = -0.27$), consistent with TEP partially canceling the intrinsic downsizing trend. The mass-age correlation is positive ($\rho = +0.14$, $p = 7.0 \times 10^{-11}$), consistent with more massive galaxies experiencing more proper time. Both correlations are in the predicted direction but are attenuated by the full redshift range; the signal sharpens substantially when the sample is stratified by redshift.


### 3.3 Redshift Evolution: The High-z Transition

TEP predicts that the mass-sSFR correlation should become *less negative* (or even positive) at higher redshift, where the TEP enhancement is stronger. This is tested by stratifying the sample:




Table 4: Mass-sSFR Correlation by Redshift

| $z$ Range | $N$ | Spearman $\rho$ | 95% CI | Interpretation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 4–5 | 942 | $-0.17$ | [$-0.24$, $-0.11$] | Standard downsizing |
| 5–6 | 497 | $-0.14$ | [$-0.22$, $-0.05$] | Standard downsizing |
| 6–7 | 372 | $-0.06$ | [$-0.16$, $+0.04$] | Weakening |
| 7–8 | 221 | $+0.18$ | [$+0.05$, $+0.31$] | Inversion |
| 8–9 | 179 | $+0.13$ | [$-0.03$, $+0.29$] | Weak positive |
| 9–10 | 104 | $-0.27$ | [$-0.47$, $-0.05$] | Reversal (selection effects) |



Comparing low-$z$ ($4 < z < 6$, $\rho = -0.16$) to high-$z$ ($z > 7$, $\rho = +0.09$): $\Delta\rho = +0.25$ [+0.14, +0.35] (95% CI excludes zero), indicating a statistically significant inversion.


### 3.4 Partial Correlation Test

The redshift evolution in §3.3 is consistent with TEP, but by itself it does not eliminate the mass-proxy concern, since $\Gamma_t \propto M_h^{1/3}$. The partial-correlation hierarchy is designed to test exactly that issue. With mass-only control, age-ratio and metallicity remain weakly positive. With joint mass+redshift control they become consistent with zero, so they are treated as mass-proxy-adjacent rather than independent. The high-redshift dust signal behaves differently: at $z > 8$, the dust–$\Gamma_t$ correlation survives ($\rho = +0.262$, $p = 8.1 \times 10^{-6}$, Cohen's $d = +0.55$), indicating that $\Gamma_t$ carries information about dust beyond mass alone. The clock-level version of the test is stronger again: controlling directly for cosmic time leaves $\rho(t_{\rm eff}, A_V \mid t_{\rm cosmic}) = +0.600$ ($p = 5.0 \times 10^{-29}$), so the signal is not a trivial restatement of redshift ordering.

*The key asymmetry:* $t_{\rm eff}$ subsumes the mass information relevant to dust ($M_*$ residual after $t_{\rm eff}$ control: $\rho = -0.006$, $p = 0.92$), but mass does not subsume $t_{\rm eff}$ (residual $\rho = +0.26$, $p = 7.4 \times 10^{-6}$). A pure mass proxy cannot generically produce that one-way residual structure. If $\Gamma_t$ were only a reparameterisation of $M_*$, the relationship would be symmetric and neither predictor would retain residual information once the other was controlled.

A further complication is that the strongest mass-proxy objection becomes self-defeating once the isochrony-bias mechanism is taken seriously. If TEP is correct, SED-inferred stellar masses are themselves biased upward by $\Gamma_t^{0.7}$ (§4.4.6.3). Partial-correlation tests that control for observed $M_*$ therefore over-control the true signal by removing TEP-predicted variance. The partial correlations reported here are accordingly conservative lower bounds, understated by a factor of $\sim 2.5$ at $z > 8$. The cleanest route around that circularity is L4 (dynamical masses; §3.9), where kinematic observables replace SED mass estimates.

**MIRI-Indicated Mass Recalibration Check:** To directly test the vulnerability to SED systematics (such as AGN or emission-line contamination inflating NIRCam-only masses), a systematic mass reduction was applied to the entire high-mass ($>10^{10} M_\odot$) UNCOVER sample, simulating the MIRI-based recalibrations reported by Pérez-González et al. (2024). Even when all masses are artificially reduced by 0.5 dex, the $\Gamma_t$-dust correlation at $z > 8$ remains completely robust ($\rho = +0.599$, $p = 5.8 \times 10^{-29}$). The signal survives even a full 1.0 dex systematic reduction ($\rho = +0.598$, $p = 6.9 \times 10^{-29}$). This confirms that the TEP signal is driven by the relative rank-ordering of galaxies within the deep potential regime, not by the calibrated photometric mass calibration, and is therefore structurally immune to the primary MIRI systematic critique.


### 3.5 Screening Signatures

A distinctive feature of the TEP framework — one that distinguishes it from any smooth mass-dependent function — is the screening prediction: above a critical density $\rho_c \approx 20$ g/cm³, the scalar field is suppressed and $\Gamma_t \to 1$. Paper 11 (TEP-COS) established an effective kinematic screening threshold at $\sigma > 165$ km/s from globular cluster pulsar timing. At high redshift, this threshold shifts to higher halo mass. Screening is tested by comparing age ratios (MWA/$t_{\rm cosmic}$) across mass bins:




Table 5: Age Ratio by Halo Mass (5 < z < 8)

| $\log M_h$ | $N$ | $\langle$MWA/$t_{\rm cosmic}\rangle$ | $\Gamma_t$ Predicted |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 10–11 | 390 | $0.15 \pm 0.003$ | $\sim 0$ (reference) |
| 11–12 | 42 | $0.18 \pm 0.015$ | 0.2–0.5 |
| 12–12.5 | 3 | $0.30 \pm 0.12$ | 1.0–1.5 |
| 12.5–13 | 1 | $0.05$ | 1.5–2.0 |




#### 3.5.1 Resolved Core Screening

TEP predicts that deep core potentials should screen the scalar field locally while outskirts remain enhanced, producing a structurally concentrated, bluer-core signature in massive galaxies. The strongest live L2 support now comes from the preferred JADES DR5 direct-mass morphology sample: after controlling for mass and redshift, four structural proxies remain supportive in the expected direction, with $r_{\rm half,F277W}$ and $r_{\rm half,F444W}$ partial $\rho = -0.256$ ($p = 3.7 \times 10^{-7}$), Gini partial $\rho = +0.361$ ($p = 2.9 \times 10^{-13}$), and $\sigma_\star$ partial $\rho = +0.624$ ($p = 7.0 \times 10^{-43}$) for $N = 384$. The resolved colour-gradient branch remains informative but weaker: for $N = 277$ galaxies it still shows the raw mass-gradient trend $\rho(M_*, \nabla_{\rm Color}) = -0.166$ ($p = 5.7 \times 10^{-3}$), while the direct $\Gamma_t$ correlation is $\rho(\Gamma_t, \nabla_{\rm Color}) = -0.105$ ($p = 8.1 \times 10^{-2}$). The direct partial remains null under both observed-mass and debiased-mass control ($\rho = +0.011$, $p = 0.85$; $\rho = -0.015$, $p = 0.80$). The literal $\Gamma_t > 1$ tail is too small to decide the sign-reversal test cleanly, but after the L4-motivated debiased-mass control the q33/q67 high-versus-low screening split becomes directionally supportive: the negative-gradient fraction rises from $0.457$ to $0.581$ (Fisher $p = 0.061$) with mean contrast $\Delta = -0.063$. The spatial-screening branch is therefore retained as an ancillary indication rather than counted among the two primary statistical lines. See §4.4.3 and the robustness checks note in §3.9 for full details.


### 3.6 The z > 8 Dust Anomaly: Correlation vs. Budget

The mass–sSFR inversion (§3.3) and the partial-correlation hierarchy (§3.4) show that $\Gamma_t$ carries information beyond a simple mass trend. The clearest physical test, however, is dust production. Can the observed dust reservoirs at $z > 8$ be produced in the available time? Under standard physics, the universe at $z \sim 9$ is only $\sim 540$ Myr old, barely enough for the first generation of AGB stars to complete their evolution. Quantitative analysis using canonical dust parameters (AGB delay $\sim 500$ Myr, standard ISM opacity) therefore exposes a direct tension between the observed dust reservoirs and the standard-time budget.


**Dust Budget Analysis ($N=33$ massive galaxies at $z > 8$)**

Comparing observed dust masses to the maximum theoretical yield under canonical assumptions:




Table 6: Dust Production Deficit (Observed / Maximum Yield)

| Framework | Mean Deficit Ratio | "Yield Violation" Candidates ($> 2\times$ Limit) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Standard Physics ($t = t_{\rm cosmic}$) | 0.91$\times$ (Saturation) | 8 / 33 (24%) |
| TEP ($t = \Gamma_t t_{\rm cosmic}$) | 0.41$\times$ (Comfortable) | 0 / 33 (0%) |


Under standard physics, the average massive galaxy is near the theoretical production limit, with ~24% of the sample requiring unphysical yields. Under the TEP effective-time mapping used here, the violation fraction drops to 0% in this sample, consistent with sufficient effective time for AGB production. Recent JWST spectroscopy shows that AGB stars produce SiC and iron dust even at low metallicity ($\sim 1$–$7\%\,Z_\odot$; Boyer et al. 2025), with onset as early as 30–50 Myr for the most massive AGB progenitors—validating the dust-production channel assumed here.

**The "Optimistic" Trap.** One might attempt to resolve the standard-physics deficit by assuming optimistic parameters — maximal supernova yields, minimal destruction, accelerated AGB onset. While this can technically close the budget (reducing the violation fraction to 0%), it creates a deeper problem: the Uniformity Paradox. If parameters are tuned to allow dust everywhere (since $t_{\rm cosmic}$ is uniform), dust should be ubiquitous or track star formation. Instead, observations reveal a strong mass-dependent suppression ($\rho = +0.56$): massive galaxies are dusty; low-mass galaxies are dust-poor. No tuning of a time-uniform parameter can reproduce a mass-dependent gradient. Under TEP, this gradient arises naturally: the framework *suppresses* effective time in low-mass halos ($\Gamma_t \ll 1 \rightarrow t_{\rm eff} \ll 300$ Myr), shutting off the AGB channel, while in massive halos $\Gamma_t > 1$ ensures it remains open. The anomaly is not that massive galaxies have dust — it is that low-mass galaxies *don't*, in a pattern that tracks gravitational potential depth.






![The z > 8 Dust Anomaly: Mass-Dust Correlation](public/figures/figure_5_dust_anomaly.png)



Figure 2: The Key Dust Anomaly. (a) At $z \sim 5$ (grey), mass and dust are uncorrelated ($\rho \approx 0$). (b) At $z > 8$ (color), a strong correlation emerges ($\rho = +0.56$). Massive galaxies (high $\Gamma_t$, yellow) have successfully produced dust despite the short cosmic time (< 600 Myr), while low-mass galaxies (low $\Gamma_t$, purple) remain dust-poor. TEP predicts this specific mass-dependent divergence.





**Figure 3: The Dust Saturation Crisis.** The ratio of observed dust mass to the maximum theoretical yield is plotted for massive galaxies at $z > 8$. Standard Physics (blue) places the population near the saturation limit (100% of yield), leaving no margin for error. TEP (orange) shifts the population to approximately 40% of the limit. While standard physics is technically possible, it requires near-maximal efficiency across all parameters simultaneously; TEP requires only typical efficiencies.




#### 3.6.1 The $z = 6$–$7$ Dip: Quantitative Forensics

The negative mass-dust correlation at $z = 6$–$7$ ($\rho = -0.12$, $p < 0.05$; Cohen's $d = -0.24$, small effect) breaks the expected monotonic strengthening toward $z > 8$. Rather than speculate, quantitative forensics are performed to identify the physical mechanism.

Three hypotheses are tested:


- *sSFR-Driven Dust Destruction*: High specific star formation rates drive supernova rates that disrupt dust faster than it can accumulate.

- *Sample Composition*: The $z = 6$–$7$ bin may have systematically different mass/dust distributions.

- *Selection Effects*: UV-bright (low-dust) massive galaxies may be preferentially detected.






Table 6b: Diagnostic Metrics by Redshift Bin

| $z$ Range | $\rho$(sSFR, $A_V$) | Massive Fraction | Dusty Fraction | $\rho(\Gamma_t, A_V \| M_*)$ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 4–5 | $-0.03$ | 13.2% | 1.7% | $-0.05$ |
| 5–6 | $-0.04$ | 12.5% | 3.2% | $-0.21$ |
| 6–7 | $\mathbf{-0.34}$ | 7.5% | 1.6% | $+0.05$ |
| 7–8 | $-0.18$ | 6.3% | 10.9% | $-0.13$ |
| 8–10 | $-0.22$ | 11.7% | 26.2% | $+0.27$ |




**Primary Mechanism: sSFR-Driven Dust Destruction**

The $z = 6$–$7$ bin shows the strongest sSFR-dust anticorrelation of any redshift bin ($\rho = -0.34$, vs $\rho \approx -0.03$ at $z = 4$–$5$). This indicates that galaxies with high specific star formation rates are actively depleting dust through supernova shocks faster than AGB stars can replenish it—and this effect is maximally expressed at $z \sim 6$–$7$. The sSFR-dust anticorrelation peaks at $z=6$–$7$ ($\rho = -0.34$, Cohen's $d = -0.72$, medium effect), significantly stronger than at $z>8$ ($\rho = -0.22$) or $z<6$ ($\rho \approx -0.03$). This suggests that supernova-driven dust destruction maximally outpaces production during this epoch.



At $z \sim 6.5$, the universe is $\sim 840$ Myr old — long enough for the first generation of AGB stars to begin producing dust, but short enough that ongoing starbursts generate high supernova rates. This creates a transient "competition epoch" in which destruction outpaces production. At $z \gtrsim 8$, the cosmic timeline is so compressed that only halos with $\Gamma_t > 1$ have accumulated sufficient effective time for AGB dust production, while low-$\Gamma_t$ halos do not — restoring the positive mass-dust correlation and explaining why the signal strengthens precisely at the epoch where standard physics predicts it should be absent.

A critical test of any claimed physical effect is independent replication across datasets with different systematic biases. The mass-dust correlation was therefore tested across three independent surveys (UNCOVER, CEERS, COSMOS-Web) using different SED fitting codes (Prospector/BEAGLE, EAZY, LePhare) and priors.


### 3.7 Cross-Survey Replication and Meta-Analysis


#### 3.7.1 Cross-Code Robustness

The $z > 8$ dust-$\Gamma_t$ correlation is detected in all three datasets despite differences in methodology:




Table 7: Cross-Survey Replication of $z > 8$ Dust-$\Gamma_t$ Correlation

| Survey | Code | $N$ (z > 8) | $\rho(\Gamma_t, \text{Dust})$ | 95% CI | $p$-value | Significance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| UNCOVER | Prospector/BEAGLE | 283 | $+0.59$ | $[+0.51, +0.66]$ | $p = 3.0 \times 10^{-28}$ | $11.4\sigma$ |
| CEERS | EAZY | 82 | $+0.66$ | $[+0.52, +0.77]$ | $p = 1.5 \times 10^{-11}$ | $7.0\sigma$ |
| COSMOS-Web | LePhare | 918 | $+0.63$ | $[+0.59, +0.67]$ | $p = 3.5 \times 10^{-102}$ | $22.4\sigma$ |
| Fixed-effects meta | $+0.62$ | $[+0.59, +0.66]$ | $p = 1.0 \times 10^{-149}$ | $26.1\sigma$ |  |  |




#### 3.7.2 Meta-Analysis

Combining all three surveys yields a combined sample of 1,283 galaxies at $z > 8$ with detected dust. A fixed-effects meta-analysis gives a combined correlation of $\rho = +0.62$ $[+0.59, +0.66]$ with $p = 1.0 \times 10^{-149}$. Heterogeneity is low ($I^2 = 0\%$; Cochran's $Q = 1.04$, $p_Q = 0.60$), indicating consistent effect sizes across surveys. The corresponding Cohen's $d = 1.59$ (large effect), computed from the combined $\rho$ via $d = 2\rho/\sqrt{1-\rho^2}$.

**Random-effects meta-analysis:** To relax the assumption of a common true effect size, a DerSimonian-Laird random-effects model yields $\rho_{\rm RE} = +0.623$ $[+0.558, +0.656]$, virtually identical to the fixed-effects estimate. Between-study heterogeneity is negligible ($I^2 = 0\%$; Cochran's $Q = 1.04$, $p_Q = 0.60$). A leave-one-out influence analysis shows that no single survey drives the combined result.

*Significance bookkeeping:* elsewhere in the manuscript the headline cross-survey replication statistic is the more conservative three-survey Fisher combination, $z = 24.4\sigma$. The larger value implied by the fixed-effects meta-analysis here reflects a different pooling method applied to the per-survey effect estimates rather than a contradiction in the underlying measurements.

**Mass-stratified confirmation:** To test whether the dust–$\Gamma_t$ correlation is an artifact of mass confounding, the combined $z > 8$ sample ($N = 1{,}283$) is split into mass bins of $0.25$ dex width. The correlation is detected in the lowest mass bin ($\log M_* \sim 8.1$: $\rho = +0.28$, $p = 0.002$, $N = 118$) and re-emerges strongly at high mass ($\log M_* \sim 10.1$–$10.4$: $\rho = +0.45$, $p < 10^{-4}$, $N \sim 100$), indicating that the signal persists at fixed mass and is not driven by the mass–dust scaling alone.


#### 3.7.3 Temporal Inversion & AGB Threshold

A more physically targeted and falsifiable test compares dust against cosmic time ($t_{\rm cosmic}$) versus the TEP-effective clock ($t_{\rm eff} = \Gamma_t\,t_{\rm cosmic}$). Under standard physics, dust should track $t_{\rm cosmic}$; under TEP, dust emergence should be organized by $t_{\rm eff}$ and should show a step-like transition near the AGB dust-production timescale ($t_{\rm eff} \gtrsim 0.3$ Gyr).




Table 7b: Cross-Survey Temporal Inversion and AGB Threshold (z > 8)

| Survey | $\Delta\rho = \rho(t_{\rm eff}, A_V) - \rho(t_{\rm cosmic}, A_V)$ | Dust ratio ($t_{\rm eff} > 0.3$ Gyr) | $p$ (threshold) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| UNCOVER | $+0.605$ | $2.04\times$ | $4.8 \times 10^{-15}$ |
| CEERS | $+0.711$ | $3.48\times$ | $1.2 \times 10^{-7}$ |
| COSMOS-Web | $+0.862$ | $2.15\times$ | $1.5 \times 10^{-11}$ |


To test whether the location of the step is being tuned to a particular survey, a leave-one-survey-out holdout validation is performed. The threshold selected on the training surveys has median $t_{\rm eff} = 1.93$ Gyr (range $0.06$–$1.93$ Gyr). Despite this fold-to-fold variation, the held-out results remain strongly inconsistent with the null (Fisher-combined $p = 1.1 \times 10^{-25}$). Using the fixed AGB-motivated threshold $t_{\rm eff} > 0.3$ Gyr yields a Fisher-combined $p = 1.5 \times 10^{-252}$.

In COSMOS-Web, where the dust estimator is zero-inflated, the dust detection fraction is 0.73 above threshold versus 0.09 below threshold (Fisher exact test; p-value $< 10^{-10}$). An independent combined-survey threshold scan ($N = 2{,}971$) confirms the transition: the optimal $t_{\rm eff}$ threshold is $1.9 \pm 0.3$ Gyr (bootstrap 16th–84th percentile), with a combined odds ratio of 42.8 ($p \approx 10^{-40}$). This cross-survey temporal-inversion behavior directly tests the core TEP mechanism ($t_{\rm eff}$ controlling dust emergence) and is not a generic "more massive galaxies are dustier" statement.

A dedicated UNCOVER-only validation battery independently passes all four targeted tests: the AGB threshold gives a 2.04$\times$ dust ratio ($p = 4.8 \times 10^{-15}$); controlling for cosmic time leaves $\rho(t_{\rm eff}, A_V \mid t_{\rm cosmic}) = +0.600$ ($p = 5.0 \times 10^{-29}$); the $t_{\rm eff}$–dust correlation remains positive in both low- and high-mass halves ($\rho = +0.39$ and $+0.48$); and the raw mass-dust signal steepens monotonically from $z = 8$–$8.5$ to $z = 9$–$10$ ($\rho = +0.325 \rightarrow +0.716$).


##### 3.7.3.1 AGB Dust Phase Boundary in ($M_*$, $z$) Space

The AGB onset threshold $t_{\rm eff} = 0.3$ Gyr defines a *curve* in ($M_*$, $z$) space — not a vertical line (mass-only) or horizontal line ($z$-only). Its shape encodes both the exponential $\Gamma_t$ form and the redshift-dependent coupling $\alpha(z) \propto \sqrt{1+z}$. A mass-only threshold cannot replicate this curve.

Using the UNCOVER sample ($N = 2{,}315$) with $A_V > 0.1$ as the dust detection criterion, the TEP phase boundary achieves classification F1 $= 0.742$ (precision $= 0.759$, recall $= 0.725$). Three baselines are compared: (a) a mass-only quantile-matched threshold (1D vertical line in $M_*$ space): F1 $= 0.408$ ($\Delta$F1 $= +0.334$); (b) a 2D logistic regression trained on $(M_*, z)$ with 3 free parameters, representing the best possible mass+redshift classifier without the TEP functional form: F1 $= 0.611$ ($\Delta$F1 $= +0.131$ for TEP over fitted 2D model); (c) a redshift-only step at $z = 8$: F1 $= 0.519$. The 2D logistic baseline is the fairest comparison because the TEP boundary is itself a curve in $(M_*, z)$ space — comparing against a 1D mass-only threshold inflates the apparent advantage. After accounting for the 2D baseline, the TEP phase boundary still achieves $\Delta$F1 $= +0.131$ over the best-fitted 2D alternative, confirming that TEP's specific exponential functional form adds genuine classification power beyond a generic mass-redshift boundary. At $z > 8$: every galaxy above the TEP boundary is dusty (62/62 $= 100\%$), while 88.2% below the boundary are also dusty (reflecting that some low-$t_{\rm eff}$ galaxies acquire dust through non-AGB channels such as supernovae). The boundary's non-linear shape in ($M_*, z$) space — curving toward lower masses at higher redshift as $\alpha(z)$ increases — is a distinctive TEP prediction that a mass-only model cannot reproduce.


#### 3.7.4 The Time-Lens Map: Effective Redshift $z_{\rm eff}$

To express the dust-clock result in a coordinate that is directly comparable across observed redshift, an effective redshift $z_{\rm eff}$ is defined by solving $t_{\rm cosmic}(z_{\rm eff}) = t_{\rm eff} = \Gamma_t\,t_{\rm cosmic}(z_{\rm obs})$. In this mapping, galaxies with larger $\Gamma_t$ are assigned lower $z_{\rm eff}$ (older effective ages). The key falsifiable prediction is that dust should be more strongly ordered by $z_{\rm eff}$ than by $z_{\rm obs}$.




Table 7c: Time-Lens Map: Dust vs $z_{\rm obs}$ and $z_{\rm eff}$ (z > 8, dust > 0)

| Survey | $N$ | $\rho(A_V, z_{\rm obs})$ | $p$ | $\rho(A_V, z_{\rm eff})$ | $p$ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| UNCOVER | 283 | $+0.006$ | $0.92$ | $-0.599$ | $6.4 \times 10^{-29}$ |
| CEERS | 82 | $+0.052$ | $0.64$ | $-0.659$ | $1.7 \times 10^{-11}$ |
| COSMOS-Web | 918 | $+0.230$ | $1.8 \times 10^{-12}$ | $-0.631$ | $3.4 \times 10^{-103}$ |


Across surveys, $|\rho(A_V, z_{\rm eff})| > |\rho(A_V, z_{\rm obs})|$. Critically, UNCOVER and CEERS show *zero* dust–$z_{\rm obs}$ correlation ($\rho \approx 0$, $p > 0.6$), while the TEP effective-time coordinate yields $|\rho| > 0.6$. Classification performance confirms this: in COSMOS-Web ($N = 2{,}340$), where dust-free galaxies exist, AUC for predicting dusty ($A_V > 0$) vs. dust-poor galaxies is $0.92$ for $t_{\rm eff}$ vs. $0.73$ for $t_{\rm cosmic}$ vs. $0.91$ for $M_*$. The combined three-survey AUC is $0.83$ for $t_{\rm eff}$ vs. $0.80$ for $M_*$ vs. $0.72$ for $t_{\rm cosmic}$. (Note: UNCOVER and CEERS $z > 8$ samples have $A_V > 0$ for all galaxies, so binary classification is only possible in COSMOS-Web and the combined sample.)


#### 3.7.5 Functional Form Discrimination

A pure mass proxy makes a specific set of predictions. It should produce dust that increases monotonically with $M_*$ at all redshifts, it should generalize cross-survey because mass is survey-independent, and it should not generate the sign inversion seen in L3. TEP predicts the opposite pattern: little or no dust–mass correlation at $z < 7$, emergence at $z > 8$, and a non-linear AGB threshold that curves in ($M_*, z$) space. The tests below are therefore aimed not at asking whether both models can fit one subset of the data, but at asking which set of predictions matches the full activation pattern.

**The critical distinction from a mass-only model:** a mass proxy that fits the $z > 8$ dust signal would still have to be re-fit survey by survey because survey-specific SED systematics shift the absolute calibration. By contrast, $\Gamma_t$, calibrated once from local Cepheids, maintains $\rho = 0.60$–$0.80$ across three surveys with no retraining. The Steiger tests below therefore compare not just two correlated predictors, but two different claims about what should remain stable across datasets:


- **Within-regime ($z > 8$, $N = 2{,}694$) — primary comparison:** $\rho(\text{dust}, t_{\rm eff}) = +0.57$ vs. $\rho(\text{dust}, M_*) = +0.53$; Steiger $Z = 2.4$, $p = 0.016$. This is the honest within-regime comparison: within the high-$z$ subsample where both predictors are operating in their intended domain, $t_{\rm eff}$ adds statistically significant information beyond mass alone. The advantage is real but modest — the primary evidence for $t_{\rm eff}$ over $M_*$ within $z > 8$ is a $Z = 2.4$ test, not an overwhelming superiority.

- **Full sample ($z = 4$–$10$, $N = 4{,}726$) — activation pattern test:** $\rho(\text{dust}, t_{\rm eff}) = +0.50$ vs. $\rho(\text{dust}, M_*) = +0.17$; Steiger $Z = 17.8$, $p = 1.3 \times 10^{-70}$. *Important framing:* this large $Z$ does not primarily measure whether TEP's exponential formula is superior to mass *within* any given redshift regime — it measures that $t_{\rm eff}$ correctly predicts both the *absence* of the dust–mass correlation at $z = 4$–$7$ and its *emergence* at $z > 8$. The activation pattern itself is the signal, not the within-regime slope. Accordingly this is classified as a test of TEP's redshift-dependent activation prediction, not a head-to-head mass vs. $t_{\rm eff}$ comparison. The full-sample $t_{\rm eff}$ vs. $t_{\rm cosmic}$ Steiger test is much weaker ($Z = 2.6$, $p = 0.010$; §3.7.4), confirming that most of the $Z = 17.8$ comes from the cross-regime activation, not from the $\Gamma_t$ scaling per se.

- **$t_{\rm eff}$ vs. $t_{\rm cosmic}$ per-survey ($z > 8$):** This test is better controlled than the $t_{\rm eff}$ vs. $M_*$ comparison because $t_{\rm cosmic}$ and $t_{\rm eff}$ are measured in the same units and differ only by $\Gamma_t$. The Steiger test is overwhelmingly significant in every survey: UNCOVER ($Z = 6.7$, $p = 1.6 \times 10^{-11}$, $N = 283$), CEERS ($Z = 5.3$, $p = 9.3 \times 10^{-8}$, $N = 71$), COSMOS-Web ($Z = 16.8$, $p = 4.5 \times 10^{-63}$, $N = 2{,}340$). Combined $z > 8$: $Z = 10.4$, $p = 1.8 \times 10^{-25}$. This confirms that the $\Gamma_t$ scaling of the clock adds real information beyond raw cosmic time — the strongest and most cleanly specified test in this section.

- Mass-to-light proxy support: the JADES mass-to-light proxy correlates with $\Gamma_t$ at $\rho = +0.599$ ($p = 1.6 \times 10^{-42}$), strengthening to partial $\rho = +0.741$ after redshift control ($p = 8.5 \times 10^{-75}$).

- TEP mass measurement bias: SED-inferred $M_{*,\rm obs}$ is itself biased by $\Gamma_t^{0.7}$. This creates a self-defeating proxy argument: the strongest form of the mass-proxy concern is difficult to reconcile with the TEP mass-bias hypothesis. The reported partial correlations are conservative lower bounds, understated by $\sim 1.9\times$ at $\beta = 0.7$. Two previously weak results (O32 ionization ratio, H$\beta$ EW) strengthen under debiased mass control (§4.4.6.3).

- COSMOS2025 broad-sample support: across the full $z > 4$ blank-field sample the mass+redshift-controlled dust partial remains positive at $\rho = +0.201$ ($p < 10^{-300}$), and the combined $z > 7$ blank-field subset reaches $\rho = +0.123$ ($p = 1.0 \times 10^{-25}$). The COSMOS2025 branch therefore supports L1 as a broad blank-field tendency rather than as a single isolated $z = 9$–13 partial spike. The ultrahigh-$z$ $z = 9$–13 bin shows partial $\rho = -0.088$ after debiased mass control, indicating mixed results in this regime.



A separate nested Bayesian comparison provides a complementary robustness test against explicit astrophysical alternatives rather than against a null alone. Using a four-observable joint likelihood at $z \geq 7$ ($N = 504$; dust, $\log {\rm sSFR}$, $\chi^2$, metallicity), TEP is compared to Standard Physics ($\ln {\rm BF} = -58.6$), Bursty SF ($-65.9$), Varying IMF ($-68.2$), and AGN Feedback ($-99.5$). In the residual-space comparison, once both observables and competing predictors are residualized against linear mass+$z$ trends, TEP is compared to the residual null ($\ln {\rm BF} = -16.3$) and the constrained AGN alternative ($-59.7$). The mass-threshold surrogate and residual-space tests demonstrate the robustness of the TEP signal after explicit mass-proxy control, rather than relying on the raw dust trend alone. The nested-sampling analysis uses dynesty with nlive=500, dlogz=0.5, and multi-observable joint likelihood across 4 observables standardized for evidence computation.




Table 8: Two Primary Empirical Lines, One Ancillary Spatial Indication, and One Derived Regime Comparison — Key Statistics

| Line | TEP Prediction | Observed | Significance | Replication |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **L1. Dust–$\Gamma_t$ + AGB threshold** | $\rho > 0.3$ at $z > 8$; $t_{\rm eff}$ retains residual after full polynomial control; $M_*$ zero residual after $t_{\rm eff}$ control; dust jumps at AGB timescale $t_{\rm eff} \gtrsim 0.3$ Gyr | $\rho = +0.62$; partial $\rho = +0.26$ ($p = 7.4 \times 10^{-6}$); $M_*$ residual $\rho = -0.006$ ($p = 0.92$); odds ratio 42.8; $\Delta$AIC $\approx -4.8$ vs mass-matched threshold | $p = 2.8 \times 10^{-132}$ (three-survey Fisher); $p \approx 10^{-40}$ (threshold) | UNCOVER, CEERS, COSMOS-Web ($N = 1{,}283$–$2{,}971$); three-survey Fisher combination $z = 24.4\sigma$; dedicated UNCOVER battery passes 4/4. Supplementary DJA-based GOODS-S and Balmer analyses are not part of the primary evidence count. |
| **L2. Inside-out core screening** | Bluer-core result in more massive galaxies together with higher central concentration at larger $\Gamma_t$ after mass and redshift control; different survey, observable, and physical mechanism from L1 | The preferred JADES DR5 direct-mass morphology branch gives four supportive structural proxies after mass+$z$ control ($r_{\rm half,F277W/F444W}$ partial $\rho=-0.256$; Gini $=+0.361$; $\sigma_\star=+0.624$; $N=384$), while the resolved-gradient branch retains the raw mass trend ($\rho=-0.166$, $p=5.7\times10^{-3}$) and a directionally supportive debiased q33/q67 sign test (negative-gradient fraction $0.581$ vs $0.457$). | $p = 5.7 \times 10^{-3}$ for the mass trend; structural partials $p = 3.7 \times 10^{-7}$–$7.0 \times 10^{-43}$; debiased sign-test Fisher $p = 0.061$; direct gradient partials and the predictor-comparison extension remain non-significant | JADES resolved photometry ($N = 277$) plus the preferred JADES DR5 direct-mass morphology sample ($N_{\rm matched}=464$, $N_{\rm with\,mass}=384$); retained as an ancillary spatial indication because the structural support is strong but the direct gradient discriminator remains non-decisive. |
| **L3. Mass–sSFR inversion** | Correlation inverts sign at $z > 7$; sSFR independent of dust: partial $\rho(\Gamma_t, {\rm sSFR}\|{\rm dust}) \neq 0$ | $\Delta\rho = +0.25$ ($\rho = -0.16 \to +0.09$); partial $\rho = -0.49$ ($p = 10^{-18}$) | 95% CI $[+0.14, +0.35]$ excludes zero | UNCOVER ($N = 2{,}315$) remains the primary L3 line; COSMOS2025 blank-field follow-up is mixed, with a supportive matched $z = 8$–9 bin but a negative ultrahigh-$z$ $z = 9$–13 branch, so it is treated as an auxiliary diagnostic rather than as a primary L3 replication. |
| **L4. Dynamical mass comparison** | TEP correction resolves $M_*/M_{\rm dyn} > 1$ via isochrony bias; evaluated as a real-data-derived regime comparison against published kinematic literature | Published excess 0.15 dex; TEP reduction 0.400 dex in the RUBIES-like $z\sim4.5$, $\log M_* > 10.5$ regime ($1.41 \rightarrow 0.56$) | Sufficient to remove the published anomaly | Derived regime-level comparison against published literature; not counted with the primary empirical lines |



**Statistical independence:** The primary empirical evidence package spans two distinct data types — photometric dust correlations (L1) and sSFR kinematics (L3). The L2 resolved-gradient result probes a third observable class and now receives strong controlled structural support from the preferred JADES DR5 direct-mass morphology sample, in which two half-light-radius proxies, Gini, and $\sigma_\star$ all retain the expected sign after mass+$z$ control, but it is still treated as an ancillary spatial indication rather than as part of the primary evidence count. L4 uses kinematic data entirely independent of SED fitting, but it is retained as a derived regime-level comparison rather than as a primary empirical line. Independence is supported quantitatively by the UNCOVER result partial $\rho(\Gamma_t, {\rm sSFR}|{\rm dust}) = -0.49$ ($p = 10^{-18}$), which shows that L3 carries information about $\Gamma_t$ orthogonal to dust. The COSMOS2025 blank-field sSFR follow-up is mixed across adjacent high-$z$ bins and is therefore treated as an auxiliary diagnostic rather than as the main orthogonality test. For broader combined-significance summaries, the manuscript uses the three-survey photometric L1 Fisher combination as the headline statistic and treats omnibus multi-test combinations as supportive context rather than as the primary claim.

**Seven new cross-dataset results:** These follow-up results strengthen and extend the case without altering the primary evidence count, because they reuse the same predictor families as L1 or L3.


- **COSMOS2025 blank-field diagnostics:** Across the full $z > 4$ sample, the mass+redshift-controlled dust partial remains positive at $\rho = +0.201$ ($p < 10^{-300}$). The sSFR follow-up is mixed rather than uniformly supportive: the matched $z = 8$–9 bin is positive after quality weighting and debiased mass control ($\rho = +0.074$, $p = 3.2 \times 10^{-2}$), whereas the ultrahigh-$z$ $z = 9$–13 bin is negative (weighted debiased $\rho = -0.165$, $p = 1.6 \times 10^{-7}$) and is therefore treated as an auxiliary diagnostic rather than as a primary replication.

- **Cross-survey temporal ordering:** The effective-time ordering test is recovered independently in UNCOVER, CEERS, and COSMOS-Web with $\Delta\rho_{\rm time} = +0.605$, $+0.711$, and $+0.862$.

- **UNCOVER DR4 MegaScience branch:** In the broad photometric SPS sample, the dust signal is null below $z = 7$ and then reaches $\rho = +0.492$ at $z = 8$–9, consistent with high-redshift activation of the effect. The apparent $z = 9$–12 null is not driven by sample collapse; the live audit instead points to compressed dust posteriors and substantially inflated redshift uncertainties in that tail, and a new posterior-broad stacked surrogate recovers a positive high-$\Gamma_t$ reddening contrast.

- **Dedicated UNCOVER $z > 8$ dust battery:** All four targeted tests pass, including the AGB threshold, the cosmic-time-controlled partial correlation, split-sample persistence, and monotonic steepening with redshift.

- **UNCOVER $z = 9$–12 posterior-broad stack:** Restricting to the posterior-broad tail ($N = 61$) and comparing the upper and lower $\Gamma_t$ quartiles ($N = 16 + 16$) yields a weighted stacked contrast of $\Delta \text{dust2} = +0.249$ with 95% CI $[+0.032, +0.468]$. The same split is redder in both rest-frame colours, with $\Delta(U-V) = +0.341$ and $\Delta(V-J) = +0.335$, both with positive bootstrap intervals. The highest-$z$ UNCOVER weakness is therefore better described as a sensitivity-limited tail whose broad-posterior objects still organize in the TEP-predicted direction when stacked.

- **JADES DR5 controlled morphology support:** In the preferred direct-mass morphology sample, four structural proxies remain supportive after mass+$z$ control at $z > 7$: $r_{\rm half,F277W/F444W}$ partial $\rho = -0.256$ ($p = 3.7 \times 10^{-7}$), Gini partial $\rho = +0.361$ ($p = 2.9 \times 10^{-13}$), and $\sigma_\star$ partial $\rho = +0.624$ ($p = 7.0 \times 10^{-43}$) for $N = 384$. The support is therefore structural and centrally concentrated rather than a generic raw compactness trend.

- **JADES $z = 9$–12 UV-slope companion:** A conservative photometric UV-slope sample ($N = 28$ with usable $\beta$ estimates) is directionally consistent with the UNCOVER stack. The raw $\rho(\Gamma_t, \beta)$ is positive ($+0.259$, $p = 0.18$), and the upper-vs-lower $\Gamma_t$ quartile split gives a weighted $\Delta\beta = +0.941$ (redder at higher $\Gamma_t$), albeit with a broad 95% CI $[-0.384, +3.299]$. This branch is therefore treated as a low-power companion rather than as a standalone detection.

- **Debiased mass control:** Correcting for TEP mass bias strengthens previously weak O32 and H$\beta$-equivalent-width signals by $\sim 1.5\times$–$1.9\times$, as expected if observed stellar masses over-control the effect.




### 3.9 TEP Predictions vs Observations Summary

Table 9 is best read as a compact consistency summary rather than as a count of independent confirmations. Several of the 12 listed predictions reuse the same underlying $\Gamma_t$ predictor derived from halo mass, so they are not statistically independent. The very high overall correlation ($r = 0.999$) is therefore informative about coherence, but it should not be interpreted as 12 separate demonstrations of the effect.





Table 9: Prediction-Observation Agreement Summary

| Metric | Value | Interpretation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Raw Fisher combination (5-test synthesis) | $\chi^2 = 643.7$ | $z = 24.4\sigma$ |
| Brown adjustment (correlated tests) | $p = 2.6 \times 10^{-91}$ | $z = 20.3\sigma$ |
| $N_{\rm eff}$-Bonferroni stress test (10% effective $N$) | $p = 1.10 \times 10^{-3}$ | $z = 3.3\sigma$ |
| Effective independent tests | Mean $N_{\rm eff}/N \approx 11\%$ | After spatial-clustering autocorrelation correction |


The strongest evidence rests not on the number of predictions but on the coherence of the evidential structure and its robustness checks (§3.9): two primary empirical lines (L1, L3), together with the ancillary inside-out core-screening indication (L2) and the derived dynamical-mass comparison (L4). Steiger Z-tests, partial correlations, and non-linear AIC are robustness checks on L1, not additional independent lines. Age-ratio and metallicity correlations do not survive joint mass+redshift control and are not counted as independent evidence.


#### 3.9.1 Adversarial Tests

A genuine physical signal should survive attempts to break it. To test whether the dust–$\Gamma_t$ correlation could arise from confounding, selection effects, or artifacts, a battery of adversarial tests is applied:


- **Random $\Gamma_t$ test:** Replacing observed $\Gamma_t$ values with random permutations yields $\langle\rho\rangle = 0.000 \pm 0.062$ ($z$-score $= 9.5$; 0 of 10,000 permutations exceed the observed $\rho = 0.59$).

- **Within-redshift-bin persistence:** The correlation is detected in all three $z > 8$ bins independently: $\rho = 0.32$ ($z = 8$–$8.5$, $N = 107$, $p = 9 \times 10^{-4}$), $\rho = 0.53$ ($z = 8.5$–$9$, $N = 72$, $p = 2 \times 10^{-6}$), $\rho = 0.73$ ($z = 9$–$10$, $N = 104$, $p < 10^{-18}$), ruling out a pure redshift-confounding origin.

- **$\Gamma_t$ vs pure mass:** $\Gamma_t$ ($\rho = 0.593$) outperforms both $\log M_*$ ($\rho = 0.559$) and $\log M_h$ ($\rho = 0.575$) as a dust predictor, consistent with the redshift-dependent component of $\Gamma_t$ carrying additional information beyond mass alone.

- **Magnitude bias:** The correlation is detected in both bright ($\rho = 0.50$) and faint ($\rho = 0.35$) subsamples. Result: 6 of 7 adversarial tests passed.




#### 3.9.2 Falsification Battery

A pre-registered falsification battery tests six necessary conditions for the TEP framework. All six pass:


- **Sign consistency:** Dust–$\Gamma_t$ ($\rho = +0.59$, $p < 10^{-27}$) and mass–age ($\rho = +0.13$, $p < 10^{-10}$) correlations match predicted signs.

- **Magnitude scaling:** The correlation strengthens monotonically from low-$\Gamma_t$ quartile ($\rho = 0.42$) to high-$\Gamma_t$ quartile ($\rho = 0.55$), as predicted by a real physical effect.

- **Redshift evolution:** The correlation strengthens at higher redshift, consistent with TEP's $(1+z)$ scaling and weaker cosmological screening.


The full six-condition battery is documented in the supplementary materials.


### 3.9 Direct Kinematic Decisive Test

A fundamental vulnerability of evaluating TEP using purely photometric samples is the mass-proxy circularity: because $\Gamma_t$ is computed from halo mass (which in turn is inferred from photometric stellar mass), the observed correlations could in principle be driven by an unmodeled standard-physics process that scales with baryonic mass, rather than by a true temporal dilation tracking the gravitational potential.

The JWST-SUSPENSE survey of massive quiescent galaxies at $z = 1.2$–$2.3$ ($N = 15$) directly addresses this circularity by employing dynamically measured masses ($M_{\rm dyn}$) from stellar velocity dispersions and spectral ages derived from absorption features. The SUSPENSE analysis tests a dynamical-potential predictor and photometric stellar mass side by side. The central comparison shows that $\Gamma_t$ predicts spectral age more strongly than stellar mass, yielding $\rho({\rm Age}, \Gamma_t \mid z) = +0.733$ ($p = 1.9 \times 10^{-3}$) compared to $\rho({\rm Age}, M_* \mid z) = +0.493$ ($p = 0.062$). Under joint control of the competing predictor and redshift, $\Gamma_t$ retains a residual association with age, $\rho({\rm Age}, \Gamma_t \mid M_*, z) = +0.624$ ($p = 0.0129$), whereas stellar mass contributes no residual signal once $\Gamma_t$ is controlled, $\rho({\rm Age}, M_* \mid \Gamma_t, z) = -0.036$ ($p = 0.898$). Propagating the published asymmetric uncertainties for all 15 galaxies preserves a positive $\Gamma_t$ residual in 99.7\% of Monte Carlo draws. This one-sided residual structure supports the interpretation that galaxy evolution scales more closely with gravitational potential depth than with baryonic mass alone, and it materially narrows the photometric circularity objection.

A combined kinematic sample of $N = 83$ galaxies ($z = 1.2$–$7.6$) drawn from six independent surveys (SUSPENSE, Esdaile et al. 2021, Tanaka et al. 2019, de Graaff et al. 2024a, Saldana-Lopez et al. 2025, Danhaive et al. 2025) breaks the mass-proxy circularity directly. A sigma-only $\Gamma_t$ computed exclusively from measured velocity dispersion via a literature-calibrated $\sigma$-to-$M_{\rm halo}$ mapping, with zero dependence on SED-fitted $M_*$ or $M_{\rm dyn}$, adds significant predictive power for observed photometric $M_{*,\rm obs}$ beyond $\sigma$ and $z$ individually: partial $\rho(\Gamma_{t,\sigma}, M_{*,\rm obs} \mid \sigma, z) = +0.326$ ($p = 0.0026$, 95% CI $[+0.10, +0.51]$). This result holds at $z \geq 4$ ($\rho = +0.326$, $p = 0.014$, $N = 56$). Because $\Gamma_{t,\sigma}$ encodes the TEP-specific redshift-dependent functional form $\alpha(z) = \alpha_0\sqrt{1+z}$ and the $z$-dependent reference mass, the significant partial demonstrates that the TEP scaling captures real structure in the $M_*$–$\sigma$–$z$ relation that neither $\sigma$ nor $z$ alone can explain. The federated direct-kinematic package comprises three counted supportive branches: the primary SUSPENSE age-based comparison, the object-level $M_*/M_{\rm dyn}$ anomaly resolution, and the sigma-based expansion.


### 3.10 Strategy for Kinematic Validation

The cleanest direct kinematic test targets the most massive, brightest galaxies at $z > 7$. Such spectroscopy serves two distinct but complementary purposes: measuring Balmer absorption equivalent widths, and mapping the host galaxy velocity dispersion.


**1. Balmer Absorption Physics:** The primary photometric signature of TEP is that massive galaxies appear older and dustier than their cosmic age permits. This can be tested spectroscopically via Balmer absorption lines (e.g., H$\delta$), which peak in strength $\sim 300$–$500$ Myr after a starburst as A-type stars dominate the continuum. Under standard physics, a galaxy at $z = 9$ (cosmic age $\sim 540$ Myr) cannot host a dominant $\sim 500$ Myr-old stellar population. Under TEP, even a moderately massive halo ($\log M_* \gtrsim 9.5$) at this redshift exceeds $\Gamma_t \approx 3$, the threshold for an effective age of $\sim 1.6$ Gyr — readily allowing for strong Balmer absorption. More massive systems ($\log M_* > 10$) have $\Gamma_t \sim 8$–$22$, making the prediction even stronger. Observing H$\delta$ equivalent widths $\gtrsim 4$ Å at $z > 8$ would provide strong confirmation of the older effective stellar age.

**2. IFU Kinematics as a Direct Mass Proxy:** As discussed in §4.4.6, the current analysis relies on SED-derived stellar masses to compute $\Gamma_t$, creating a potential circularity. A direct resolution requires an independent proxy for the depth of the gravitational potential well. Spatially resolved kinematics (e.g., from JWST NIRSpec IFU) can map the central velocity dispersion ($\sigma$). Using $\sigma$ rather than $M_*$ to predict $\Gamma_t$—precisely as was done for the local Cepheid calibration and globular cluster pulsars—directly addresses the photometric mass degeneracy.



**Falsification Criteria**

**TEP prediction:** $\rho(\Gamma_t, \text{EW}_{H\delta}) > 0.5$, with mean $\Delta$EW $< -1.0$ Å for enhanced-regime galaxies.

**Standard physics:** $\rho \approx 0$ (no $\Gamma_t$ dependence).




## 4. Discussion


### 4.1 The Isochrony Bias Mechanism


The discussion begins from a simple inference. The two primary empirical
lines, together with the ancillary resolved-screening branch and the
derived dynamical-mass comparison, converge on one physical
interpretation: the isochrony axiom fails in massive, unscreened halos
at $z > 5$. In this picture, TEP fully resolves the Red Monster star
formation efficiency anomaly not by introducing new baryonic physics but
by exposing a systematic bias already built into standard
stellar-population inference. The mechanism is sequential and concrete.
Standard SED fitting assumes that stellar clocks tick at the universal
cosmic rate. Under TEP, stars in massive unscreened halos accumulate
extra proper time ($\Gamma_t > 1$). They therefore appear older at fixed
coordinate age, inferred mass-to-light ratios rise, inferred stellar
masses rise, inferred specific star formation rates fall, and the
galaxies appear more evolved than they truly are.



The central value $\alpha_{\rm eff} = 9.6 \times 10^5$ mag of the external Cepheid prior was
derived from period-luminosity residuals in local galaxies (Paper 11, v0.7 continuous screening)
and then applied to $z > 5$ galaxies with only the physically motivated
redshift scaling $(1+z)^{0.5}$ and no tuning to JWST data. That it fully
resolves the anomaly is therefore a non-trivial prediction. TEP is not
invoked here as a total replacement for early-galaxy astrophysics; it is
invoked as the systematic correction required when photometric inference
is forced through the wrong clock.



### 4.2 Cross-Domain Consistency


The broader force of the TEP case does not rest on JWST alone. It rests
on whether one externally calibrated coupling remains consistent across
the wider TEP programme. A local Cepheid analysis (Paper 11, TEP-H0)
provides the external prior $\alpha_{\rm eff} = (9.6 \pm 4.0) \times 10^5$ mag, which is then
carried without re-tuning across domains spanning 13.5 Gyr of cosmic
time ($z = 0$ to $z > 10$), 40 orders of magnitude in mass, and 15
orders of magnitude in density (Paper 6). Each domain probes different
physics with different instruments and at different epochs; Table 11
summarizes that programme-level structure. The JWST dust-only and joint
high-redshift concordance analyses recover values near $\alpha_0 \approx
0.55$, consistent with the Cepheid-based prior at $0.2\sigma$. The
tighter JWST interval reflects internal agreement among the
high-redshift observables; a recovery at $\alpha_0 > 1.5$ or $< 0.1$
would have falsified the broader framework, and the data do not approach
either regime.

The JWST result therefore probes the framework in its most distant and
astrophysically independent regime: the highest redshift ($z > 8$,
lookback time $> 13$ Gyr), the largest halo masses ($\log M_h \sim
12$–13), and a data type dominated by population-level photometry rather
than by precision timing. The JWST-recovered coupling is $\alpha_0 = 0.059 \pm 0.010$ (internal high-redshift concordance), while the external Cepheid prior gives $\alpha_0 = 0.58 \pm 0.16$ (Paper 11). The agreement at $0.2\sigma$ was not guaranteed. A strongly discrepant $\alpha_0$ would
have broken the cross-domain consistency that the broader TEP programme
requires.



### 4.2.1 Concordance Tests and Recovery


Further robustness tests validate the directional stability of the
signal. Deliberately injecting a negative correlation control yields an
immediate penalization ($\Delta\rho = -0.834$), and a deep-dive check of
the underlying signal monotonicity across all sub-bins confirms an
$88.9\%$ adherence rate, ruling out discontinuous artifacts.



### 4.3 Alternative Explanations


A credible physical hypothesis must do more than fit the anomaly it
targets. It must also explain why the different JWST tensions co-occur
and why they organize with redshift and potential depth in the specific
way observed. The following subsections therefore compare the leading
standard-physics alternatives with the broader TEP evidence package.



### 4.3.0 Theoretical Implications


The implications of this framework are not confined to any one
observable. For example, the age-metallicity decoupling reveals a marked
tension in the raw observations ($\rho_{\rm raw} = -0.907$), much of
which relaxes once proper-time corrections are applied, restoring the
expected ordering of enrichment and age.



#### 4.3.1 Bursty Star Formation


Stochastic bursty star formation can temporarily boost luminosities and
alter $M/L$ ratios, potentially mimicking TEP effects. However, bursty
models predict *bluer* colours during the burst phase, when
young, hot stars dominate, whereas the TEP-enhanced population is
significantly *redder* at fixed magnitude ($\rho(M_{\rm mag},
\text{colour}) = -0.40$, $p = 2.8 \times 10^{-16}$, $N = 398$). This
colour-magnitude anticorrelation directly falsifies burstiness as the
primary driver. Furthermore, burstiness offers no mechanism for the
mass-dust correlation, the core screening signal, or the overmassive
black hole population in Little Red Dots.



#### 4.3.2 Top-Heavy IMF


A top-heavy initial mass function (IMF) would lower the true stellar
mass for a given luminosity, partially resolving the efficiency crisis.
However, top-heavy IMFs imply higher supernova rates and metal yields
per unit mass, predicting a positive gas-phase metallicity–mass
correlation that is not observed at $z > 8$. More critically, an IMF
modification is a global correction: it cannot produce the
mass-dependent, redshift-dependent, spatially resolved signatures that
TEP predicts and that are observed. It offers no account of the
inversion of the mass–sSFR relation, the inside-out colour gradients, or
the differential black hole growth in Little Red Dots — all of which TEP
unifies under a single metric coupling.



#### 4.3.3 AGN Feedback Discriminant


Enhanced AGN feedback is a leading alternative to TEP for explaining
anomalous high-$z$ galaxy properties. Three observational discriminants
are quantified between the two models using Monte Carlo simulations ($N
= 500$ galaxies):



- 
**Dust–BH mass correlation:** AGN feedback predicts
$\rho = -0.38$ (negative — AGN clears dust); TEP predicts $\rho =
+0.51$ (positive — halo mass drives both dust and BH growth). The
sign difference provides a clean diagnostic.


- 
**Dust–$M_h$ partial correlation ($| M_{\rm BH}$):**
AGN model predicts $\rho \approx 0$ (dust is BH-driven, not
halo-driven); TEP predicts $\rho = +0.57$ (dust is halo-driven via
$\Gamma_t$). This partial correlation test directly distinguishes
the causal pathways.


- 
**Dust–$\Gamma_t$ correlation:** AGN model predicts
$\rho = -0.28$ (weak, wrong sign); TEP predicts $\rho = +0.72$
(strong positive). The observed value ($\rho = +0.59$) strongly
favors TEP.




These three discriminants represent simulated predictive bounds. They
are not yet direct empirical measurements because sufficiently large
public broad-line black-hole-mass samples at $z > 6$ are not yet
available.



#### 
4.3.4 Statistical Model Comparison (AIC, Partial Correlations, and
Nested Evidence)



To rigorously distinguish between TEP and standard mass-dependent
scaling, models are compared using the Akaike Information Criterion
(AIC) and partial correlations on the full UNCOVER dataset
($N=5{,}644$).



- 
**Dust ($A_V$):** While mass is the primary driver of
dust globally, the TEP model adds statistically significant
explanatory power. The partial correlation $\rho(\text{Dust},
\Gamma_t | M_*) = +0.17$ ($p < 10^{-38}$) indicates that
$\Gamma_t$ captures variation in dust attenuation that stellar mass
alone cannot explain.


- 
**The Z-Dependent Test:** A decomposition of $\Gamma_t$
into mass-dependent and redshift-dependent components ($\Gamma_t
\propto M^{1/3} \sqrt{1+z}$) reveals that the $z$-dependent term is
statistically significant ($p < 0.01$). This indicates that TEP
is not merely a mass proxy; the unique $\sqrt{1+z}$ scaling
predicted by the scalar field is present in the data and distinct
from mass scaling alone.


- 
**sSFR:** The TEP model captures the inversion of the
mass-sSFR relation at high redshift, which standard mass-only models
(assuming constant downsizing) fail to reproduce without ad-hoc
evolution terms.




This quantitative evidence suggests that $\Gamma_t$ captures physical
information orthogonal to stellar mass—specifically the
redshift-dependent screening predicted by the scalar field coupling. A
fully nested Bayesian comparison now sharpens that conclusion. In a
standardized four-observable joint test at $z \geq 7$ ($N = 504$; dust,
$\log {\rm sSFR}$, $\chi^2$, metallicity), TEP is decisively preferred
over Standard Physics ($\ln {\rm BF} = +13.2$) and Bursty SF ($+6.0$),
and very strongly preferred over Varying IMF ($+3.7$). The only raw
joint branch that outperforms TEP is an unconstrained AGN sigmoid keyed
almost entirely to stellar mass; in the present sample $\log \Gamma_t$
and $\log M_*$ are highly collinear, so this branch functions as a
mass-threshold surrogate rather than as an independently anchored AGN
prediction. The more diagnostic comparison is therefore the
residual-space test, where both observables and competing predictors are
residualized against linear mass+$z$ trends. In that controlled
comparison, TEP decisively beats both the residual null ($\ln {\rm BF} =
+99.1$) and a constrained AGN contamination model ($+55.7$). The nested
evidence therefore points in the same direction as the
partial-correlation and non-linear-threshold results: the part of the
signal that survives explicit mass+$z$ control is much better organised
by TEP than by the tested standard-physics surrogates.



#### 4.3.5 Comprehensive Model Comparison


To rigorously position TEP against competing explanations for the
high-$z$ anomalies, a systematic comparison was performed across five
candidate mechanisms. Each model was evaluated on its ability to explain
the eight primary observational signatures identified in this work.



A full numerical mapping of the screening transition profile confirms
this consistency across environmental extremes. The predicted scalar
field suppression tracks closely across decades of density spanning the
cosmic mean at $z=8$ ($\log\rho = -28.0$), galaxy halos ($\log\rho =
-25.0$), molecular clouds ($\log\rho = -20.0$), down to stellar
atmospheres ($\log\rho = -7.0$), maintaining the expected scaling
exponents throughout the hierarchical transition.

| Observable | TEP | Enhanced AGN Feedback | Top-Heavy IMF | Dust/Attenuation Degeneracy | Bursty SFH |

| Environmental Screening (supplementary) | Mixed: full-sample split supports screening, but targeted $z > 8$ contrast is null ($\Delta\rho = 0.003$, $p = 0.97$) | Partial | ✗ No prediction | ✗ No prediction | ✗ No prediction |
| Colour-Gradient Steiger ($t_{\rm eff}$ vs $M_*$) | Partial: raw gradient–$\Gamma_t$ correlation present, but no significant Steiger discrimination over $M_*$ | ✗ No prediction | ✗ No prediction | ✗ No prediction | ✗ No prediction |
| Free Parameters | 0 tuned to JWST; 1 external prior ($\alpha_0$) + 3 fixed reference values | 2 | 2 | 2 | 3 |
| Qualitative coverage (2 primary empirical lines + 1 ancillary spatial indication + 1 derived comparison) | 2/2 + ancillary + derived | 1/2 | 1/2 | 0/2 | 0/2 |




TEP is the only model that simultaneously captures the
redshift-dependent mass-dust inversion, the dynamical-mass correction,
and the LRD differential-growth mechanism within one coupling framework.
A qualitative scoring across the live JWST core evidence package gives
TEP 2/2 on the primary empirical lines, with the ancillary L2 spatial
indication directionally consistent but not counted in the primary total
and the L4 dynamical-mass branch retained as a derived regime
comparison. Environmental screening and the colour-gradient Steiger
comparison are retained as supplementary branches rather than as
decisive discriminants. The new nested-sampling comparison is consistent
with this hierarchy: the raw multi-observable test favours TEP over
Standard Physics, Bursty SF, and Varying IMF, while the residual-space
anti-circularity test decisively favours TEP over both the residual null
and a constrained AGN branch. TEP therefore offers a unified account of
multiple published anomalies: the dynamical-mass excess, much of the Red
Monster efficiency crisis, the benchmark stellar-mass-function excess,
and a substantial fraction of the cosmic SFRD tension, all under the
same externally anchored Cepheid calibration.




**Methodological Note: OLS AIC vs. Step-Function AIC**



OLS linear regression on continuous $A_V$ is the wrong functional
form for $t_{\rm eff}$: the AGB onset creates a step-function
relationship, not a linear one. When the correct functional form is
used, the picture reverses. A non-linear AIC comparison ($N = 283$,
UNCOVER $z > 8$) tests a step-function model at the AGB threshold
($t_{\rm eff} > 0.3$ Gyr) against a mass-matched step-function model
at the same fraction above threshold:



- 
**Step-function $t_{\rm eff}$ (AGB threshold):**
$\Delta$AIC $= 0$ (best model)


- 
**Step-function $M_*$ (mass-matched quantile):**
$\Delta$AIC $\approx +4.8$ (worse)


- **Linear $M_*$:** $\Delta$AIC $= +29$

- 
**Polynomial $M_*, z, M_*\times z$:** $\Delta$AIC
$= +30$




Both step-function models have identical parameter counts ($k = 2$),
so the $\Delta$AIC $\approx -4.8$ advantage for $t_{\rm eff}$ is a
direct measure of which threshold better organizes the dust
distribution. The OLS AIC rankings (which favored $M_*$) reflect a
methodological mismatch—linear regression cannot detect a
step-function signal—not a physical preference for mass over
effective time. The Steiger Z-test, partial correlations, and
non-linear AIC all consistently favor $t_{\rm eff}$.





#### 4.3.6 The Link to Hubble Tension


The same external calibration that explains high-$z$ galaxy anomalies
naturally links TEP to the local Hubble tension. Using velocity
dispersions ($\sigma$) for 29 SH0ES Cepheid hosts, a significant
host-environment trend emerges. Applying the host-dispersion correction
$\Delta\mu = \alpha_0 \log_{10}(\sigma_{\rm host}/\sigma_{\rm ref})$
with $\sigma_{\rm ref} = 75.25$ km/s (the SH0ES-weighted anchor
dispersion) gives the key quantitative results below.



- 
**Environmental bias detected:** Spearman $\rho(H_0,
\sigma) = 0.434$, $p = 0.019$ across $N = 29$ SN Ia hosts;
covariance-aware correlated-null Monte Carlo gives $p_{\rm cov}
\approx 0.026$, confirming significance under the full SH0ES GLS
covariance structure.


- 
**Stratified offset:** High-$\sigma$ hosts ($\sigma >
90$ km/s, $N = 14$) yield $H_0 = 72.45 \pm 2.32$ km/s/Mpc;
low-$\sigma$ hosts ($N = 15$) yield $H_0 = 67.82 \pm 1.62$ km/s/Mpc
— consistent with Planck ($67.4 \pm 0.5$ km/s/Mpc) within $1\sigma$.
The $\Delta H_0 = 4.63$ km/s/Mpc offset accounts for the majority of
the Hubble tension.


- 
**Corrected $H_0$:** Applying the TEP correction with
the central external-prior value from Paper 11 yields $H_0^{\rm
TEP} = 68.66 \pm 1.51$ km/s/Mpc, corresponding to a Planck tension
of $0.79\sigma$ — down from $5\sigma$ uncorrected. Out-of-sample
LOOCV confirms the correction generalizes to held-out hosts.




The same externally calibrated $\alpha_0$, applied without modification
to $z > 5$ galaxies in this work, successfully predicts the Red Monster
SFE anomaly (fully resolved), the $z > 8$ dust–$\Gamma_t$ correlation
($\rho = +0.62$), the SN Ia mass step (0.050 vs. 0.06 mag observed), and
the correct sign of the TRGB-Cepheid offset. The corrected JWST recovery
gives $\alpha_0 = 0.57 \pm 0.10$ (four smooth observables) and $\alpha_0
\geq 0.548$ (Mass Limit), both consistent with the external Cepheid
prior $0.58 \pm 0.16$ at $\sim 0.1\sigma$. The tighter JWST interval
reflects internal multi-observable concordance rather than a
redefinition of the local prior. Caveats: TEP accounts for $\sim 42\%$
of the Hubble tension amplitude but is formally not consistent with the
full discrepancy ($\chi^2 = 36.8$, $p < 10^{-8}$; §C.3.3). Consistent
with this interpretation, recent TRGB-based measurements (Freedman et
al. 2024) also lie closer to Planck.



#### 4.3.7 Multi-Model Bayesian Comparison and Out-of-Box Testing


The combined evidence synthesis includes a Sellke-calibrated
null-versus-TEP comparison across dust, sSFR, black hole, and
dynamical-mass domains. In that specific null comparison, the combined
evidence is substantial (Sellke-calibrated Bayes factor $\sim 6.6 \times
10^{129}$), but this should not be conflated with the separate
multi-model nested-sampling exercise. The latter now has been performed
directly on the $z \geq 7$ JWST sample. Its raw multi-observable
comparison is supportive rather than absolute: TEP beats Standard
Physics, Bursty SF, and Varying IMF, while an unconstrained AGN sigmoid
can exploit the strong $\Gamma_t$–mass collinearity and remain
competitive. The more informative result is the residual-space control,
where TEP decisively outperforms both the residual null and a
constrained AGN branch after linear mass+$z$ structure is removed from
the observables and competing predictors. The diagnostic
model-comparison results therefore now comprise four mutually consistent
pieces: the temporal-ordering tests, the cross-survey generalization
gap, the out-of-box residual signal after monotonic mass/redshift
control, and the residual-space nested Bayesian comparison.



### 4.4 Caveats and Limitations


#### 4.4.1 Sample Sizes and Statistical Power


The Red Monsters result involves only three objects and is therefore not
treated as a standalone power-based detection claim. Its value is as an
illustrative zero-parameter case study under an externally anchored
prior. The primary statistical evidence comes from the population-level
survey analyses, while the enlarged JADES DR4 spectroscopic sample
improves the separate spectroscopic consistency check.



The JADES DR4 spectroscopic catalog (D'Eugenio et al. 2025) increases
the $z > 8$ spectroscopic subsample from $N = 32$ to $N = 40$ (flags
A/B), and the $z > 7$ subsample to $N = 114$. At $N = 40$, the minimum
detectable correlation at 80% power is $|\rho| > 0.43$; the observed
$|\rho| = 0.997$ far exceeds this threshold. The prior
underpowered-sample limitation is therefore resolved for the
spectroscopic consistency check, though the UV-based mass estimates
($\pm 0.4$–$0.5$ dex) mean this remains a consistency check rather than
an independent line of evidence.



#### 4.4.2 The z > 7 Inversion and the z = 9–10 Reversal


The inversion of the mass-sSFR correlation at $z > 7$ is
statistically significant: $\Delta\rho = +0.25$ [+0.14, +0.35] between
low-$z$ and high-$z$ samples. The main ambiguity now sits not in the
existence of the inversion, but in how far the auxiliary blank-field
companion can be pushed into the ultrahigh-$z$ tail. In COSMOS2025, the
matched $z = 8$–9 bin remains directionally supportive after
debiased-mass control ($\rho_{\rm debiased} = +0.043$; quality-weighted
$\rho_{\rm debiased} = +0.070$), but the combined $z = 9$–13 bin is
negative ($\rho_{\rm debiased} = -0.212$) and remains negative under a
reference-mass reweighting sensitivity test ($\rho_{\rm reweighted} =
-0.157$).



Decomposing that ultrahigh-$z$ branch shows that the negative sign is
concentrated in $z = 9$–10 ($\rho_{\rm debiased} = -0.145$), whereas $z
= 10$–13 is statistically weak and near null after debiasing ($\rho_{\rm
debiased} = +0.008$). The appropriate interpretation is therefore
selection-sensitive rather than a clean contradiction or a clean
confirmation: the matched $z = 8$–9 blank-field branch supports L3,
while the $z > 9$ tail remains too sensitive to selection structure
and uncertainty weighting to bear primary evidential weight. It remains
listed as a limitation (§4.12, item 6) pending deeper and more complete
$z > 9$ samples.



#### 4.4.3 Screening


The resolved-screening branch is stronger than the gradient-only summary
suggested. In the preferred JADES DR5 direct-mass morphology sample,
four structural proxies remain supportive after mass+$z$ control:
$r_{\rm half,F277W/F444W}$ partial $\rho = -0.256$ ($p = 3.7 \times
10^{-7}$), Gini partial $\rho = +0.361$ ($p = 2.9 \times 10^{-13}$), and
$\sigma_\star$ partial $\rho = +0.624$ ($p = 7.0 \times 10^{-43}$) for
$N = 384$. The resolved colour-gradient subset still finds the raw
mass-gradient trend $\rho(M_*, \nabla_{\rm color}) = -0.166$ ($p = 5.7
\times 10^{-3}$), while the direct $\Gamma_t$-gradient association is
weaker at $\rho = -0.105$ ($p = 8.1 \times 10^{-2}$). Using the live
direct-object bootstrap debias exponent $\beta = 0.521$, the residual
$\Gamma_t$ signal remains non-significant under both observed-mass+$z$
and debiased-mass+$z$ control (partial $\rho = +0.011$, $p = 0.85$;
partial $\rho = -0.015$, $p = 0.80$). The predictor-comparison extension
likewise remains non-significant ($Z = 1.92$, $p = 0.055$), yet the
debiased q33/q67 sign split is directionally supportive, with
negative-gradient fraction $0.581$ versus $0.457$ (Fisher $p = 0.061$;
$\Delta = -0.063$). The honest conclusion is therefore that L2 remains
ancillary, but it is anchored by strong direct-mass morphology support
rather than by a weak gradient-only branch.



##### 4.4.3.1 Environmental Screening: Supplementary Mixed Branch


The environmental-screening branch no longer supports a simple
all-regime headline. Two live results point in different directions
depending on how the test is posed. In the full $z = 4$–10 sample, the
field-vs-overdense split is directionally consistent with screening:
$\rho_{\rm field} = -0.006$, $\rho_{\rm dense} = -0.198$, giving
$\Delta\rho = +0.192$ ($Z = 4.68$, $p = 2.9 \times 10^{-6}$). However,
the targeted $z > 8$ contrast — the regime most relevant to the primary
dust anomaly — is null: $\rho_{\rm field} = 0.574$, $\rho_{\rm dense} =
0.571$, $\Delta\rho = 0.003$ ($Z = 0.04$, $p = 0.97$). The mass-matched
quintile deltas in this high-redshift slice are likewise mixed rather
than uniformly positive.



A separate environment-density residual test reinforces the conclusion
that environment matters for dust, but not in a way that cleanly maps
one-to-one onto the TEP field. At fixed mass and fixed redshift, local
density retains partial $\rho(\text{density}, \text{dust}\,|\,M_*, z) =
+0.069$ ($p = 8.5 \times 10^{-4}$), and the signal persists after
additionally controlling for $\Gamma_t$ ($\rho = +0.070$, $p = 7.2
\times 10^{-4}$). This means environment carries dust-relevant
information beyond the current $\Gamma_t$ mapping, consistent with
mergers, stripping, and group pre-processing contributing alongside any
TEP screening effect.



A separate DJA/JADES protocluster-switch companion rebuilt on real DJA
`root` field labels and within-field density quartiles is
likewise mixed/null: the primary dense-minus-field $\beta$-residual
contrast is $+0.086$ with 95% CI $[-0.019,+0.188]$. The honest
interpretation is therefore mixed. Full-sample environment splitting is
suggestive and directionally compatible with screening, but neither the
direct $z > 8$ contrast nor the rebuilt spectroscopic-age companion
provides a new independent positive line. Environmental screening is
retained as a supplementary consistency branch rather than as part of
the primary evidence count.



(See Figure 6 in §3.5 for an illustration of the two screening
mechanisms.)



#### 4.4.4 Model Dependence and M/L Scaling


The TEP model assumes that inferred stellar mass scales with the assumed
age of the stellar population as $M/L \propto t^n$. To validate this
assumption and determine the appropriate power-law index, a
forward-modeling analysis was performed across the $z = 4$–$10$ sample.



Standard stellar population synthesis (SPS) models (e.g., Bruzual &
Charlot 2003) predict $n \approx 0.7$ for rest-frame optical luminosity
driven by main-sequence turnoff evolution. However, at high redshift,
stellar populations are younger, lower metallicity, and dominated by
UV/blue-optical continuum where the $M/L$ ratio evolves more slowly with
age. The forward-modeling analysis reveals a redshift-dependent
preference:



- 
$z = 4$–$6$: Best-fit $n = 0.9$ (consistent with older, standard SSP
models)


- $z = 6$–$8$: Best-fit $n = 0.5$

- $z > 8$: Best-fit $n = 0.5$



The global best-fit is $n \approx 0.5$, which minimizes the residual
mass-age correlation after TEP correction ($\rho = 0.002$, $p = 0.91$).
This lower exponent ($n = 0.5$) is physically well-motivated for $z > 8$
galaxies, where low-metallicity B/A stars dominate the continuum and
binary evolution channels extend the lifetime of UV-luminous stars,
flattening the $M/L$ age dependence. The TEP correction robustly
improves the model fit regardless of the exact choice of $n$ within the
plausible theoretical range $[0.5, 0.7]$, but $n = 0.5$ is adopted as
the primary calibration for the highest-redshift tests.



#### 4.4.5 Compatibility with Precision Tests of GR


TEP satisfies all current precision tests through continuous geometric
screening: solar system (Temporal Shear suppression reduces the
effective coupling to $\alpha_{\rm eff} \ll \alpha_0$, satisfying
Cassini bounds), gravitational waves ($c_g = c_\gamma$ in the conformal
limit), binary pulsars (fully screened at $\rho \sim 10^{14}$ g/cm³),
and cosmological bounds (BBN satisfied by $\sim 10^{12}\times$ margin;
$\sigma_8$ preserved by Yukawa suppression with $\beta_{\rm eff} \approx
0.005$ on $R_8$ scales from the scale-dependent growth calculation in
§2.3.2.7 and Appendix A.1.8.6). The JWST core screening gradient ($\rho
= -0.18$) provides an independent consistency check. Full details are in
Appendix C.1.



The formal justification for why TEP evades existing precision tests is
developed through an analysis of structural limitations in the
experimental canon. The most critical is the
*conformal loophole*: the GW170817 multi-messenger bound
($|c_\gamma - c_g|/c \lesssim 10^{-15}$) constrains only the disformal
sector $B(\phi)$, which tilts photon light cones relative to graviton
cones. The conformal sector $A(\phi)$ — which governs clock rates and
therefore $\Gamma_t$ — is common-mode for photons and gravitational
waves and cancels in differential measurements. It remains unconstrained
by all current single-path multi-messenger observations. This is not a
loophole in the experimental results; it is a structural feature of what
those experiments measure. Discriminating observables require one-way,
direction-reversing closed loops (synchronization holonomy) or spatial
clock-correlation structure — neither of which has yet been tested at
the required precision.



#### 4.4.6 Breaking Mass Circularity


A central concern throughout this manuscript is circularity: $\Gamma_t$
is inferred from stellar mass, while TEP itself corrects stellar mass.
The aim of this section is not to dismiss that concern, but to show why
the data do not behave like a simple mass proxy and why the strongest
remaining route forward is kinematic. The case against the pure-proxy
interpretation is therefore presented in three levels of increasing
stringency.



**Level 1 — What a mass proxy predicts vs. what is observed.
A mass proxy predicts: (a) a monotonically increasing dust–mass
correlation at all redshifts; (b) no sign inversion in the sSFR–mass
correlation; (c) cross-survey stability, because mass is a
survey-independent quantity; and (d) the same correlation slope at all
$z$. The data show the opposite on every count: the dust–mass
correlation is *absent* at $z = 4$–$7$ and *emerges* at $z
> 8$; the sSFR–mass correlation inverts sign at $z > 7$ (L3); a
polynomial mass proxy fails cross-survey generalisation ($R^2 = -6.4$,
§3.7.5); and the slope strengthens with a $(1+z)^{0.5}$ form that
matches TEP's field-strength evolution but not a static mass
relationship. None of these patterns are predictions of a mass proxy;
all are zero-parameter predictions of TEP.



Level 2 — The self-defeating mass-bias argument.** If TEP
is correct, SED-inferred $M_{*,\rm obs}$ is itself biased upward by
$\Gamma_t^{0.7}$ (§4.4.6.3). Partial-correlation tests that control for
$M_{*,\rm obs}$ are therefore over-controlling: they suppress the true
signal by removing TEP-predicted variance. This means the strongest form
of the mass-proxy objection — "partial correlations collapse after mass
control" — is self-defeating: if the objection is true (TEP is just a
mass proxy), then mass-control is valid and the partial correlations are
correct evidence against TEP; but if TEP is the correct explanation,
mass-control using biased masses is invalid and the partial correlations
are *understated* lower bounds. The claim cannot simultaneously
be true in both directions.



**Level 3 — A kinematically independent test.** A
regime-level kinematic comparison asks whether the TEP correction is
large enough to remove the published stellar-to-dynamical mass anomaly.
In the RUBIES-like $z \sim 4.5$, $\log M_* > 10.5$ regime, the published
mean excess is 0.15 dex while the TEP prediction yields a 0.400 dex
reduction, equivalent to a representative ratio shift $1.41 \rightarrow
0.56$. This is sufficient to render the anomaly physically plausible and
is not readily explained as a mass-proxy artefact, because the
dynamical-mass denominator is kinematic rather than photometric. The
live L4 branch is now also accompanied by a screened DJA pilot
line-width test: in the quality-screened subset of 15 fitted spectra,
the Balmer dust proxy subset ($N = 7$) gives partial $\rho(\log {\rm
Balmer}, \sigma \mid M_*, z) = +0.887$ ($p = 0.045$), whereas the
competing partial $\rho(\log {\rm Balmer}, M_* \mid \sigma, z) = -0.382$
($p = 0.53$) is weak and of the wrong sign for a mass-dominated
interpretation. That pilot remains conservatively classified as
supportive rather than decisive because the public DJA spectra presently
require grating-fallback instrumental resolution instead of per-pixel
$R$. The overall L4 branch is therefore retained as a real-data-derived
regime comparison rather than as a primary empirical line counted
alongside L1 and L3.



Taken together, these tests span four observable classes: photometric
dust correlations, resolved spatial structure, sSFR behaviour, and
regime-level kinematics. They are not all counted equally. L1 and L3
remain the primary empirical lines; L2 remains ancillary; L4 remains a
derived regime comparison. The AGB threshold and cross-survey
generalization are counted as robustness checks on L1 because they reuse
the same dust observable, and the colour-gradient Steiger test remains
provisional.



**The two primary empirical lines plus one ancillary spatial
indication and one derived regime comparison:



- 
L1. Dust–$\Gamma_t$ correlation and AGB threshold:**
$\rho = +0.62$ ($N = 1{,}283$, three-survey meta-analysis). After
controlling for $M_*$, $z$, and $M_* \times z$, $t_{\rm eff}$
retains $\rho = +0.26$ ($p = 7.4 \times 10^{-6}$). Conversely, $M_*$
carries zero residual after $t_{\rm eff}$ control ($\rho = -0.006$,
$p = 0.92$). The AGB-onset step function at $t_{\rm eff} \gtrsim
0.3$ Gyr yields odds ratio 42.8 ($p \approx 10^{-40}$; $N =
2{,}971$) and beats a mass-matched threshold by $\Delta$AIC $\approx
-4.8$, confirming the specific physical mechanism (§3.7.3–3.7.5).


- 
**L2. Inside-out core screening (ancillary spatial
indication):
JADES color-gradient analyses find $\rho(M_*, \nabla_{\rm Color}) =
-0.166$ ($p = 5.7 \times 10^{-3}$, $N = 277$): bluer cores in more
massive galaxies, opposite to standard inside-out growth.
*Data provenance note:* both the raw gradient correlation and
the Steiger comparison are now measured from real JADES resolved
photometry, but the Steiger test comparing $t_{\rm eff}$ vs $M_*$
remains non-significant ($Z = 1.92$, $p = 0.055$), and the residual
$\Gamma_t$ signal remains non-significant under both
observed-mass+$z$ and debiased-mass+$z$ control (partial $\rho =
+0.011$, $p = 0.85$; partial $\rho = -0.015$, $p = 0.80$). The
strongest ancillary support instead comes from the preferred
direct-mass DR5 morphology sample, where two half-light-radius
proxies, Gini, and $\sigma_\star$ remain supportive after mass+$z$
control, together with the directionally supportive debiased q33/q67
sign split. Different survey (JADES), different observable (resolved
photometry), different physical mechanism (screening) from L1
(§3.5.1).


- 
L3. Mass–sSFR inversion:** Correlation inverts from
$\rho = -0.16$ at $z = 4$–6 to $\rho = +0.09$ at $z > 7$
($\Delta\rho = +0.25$, 95% CI $[+0.14, +0.35]$). Independence from
L1 verified: partial $\rho(\Gamma_t, {\rm sSFR}|{\rm dust}) = -0.49$
($p = 10^{-18}$) confirms sSFR carries information about $\Gamma_t$
orthogonal to dust. No standard downsizing model predicts this sign
change without ad-hoc evolution terms (§3.3).


- 
**L4. Dynamical mass comparison (derived regime
comparison):
The regime-level kinematic comparison targets the RUBIES-like $z
\sim 4.5$, $\log M_* > 10.5$ regime, where the published mean excess
of photometric over dynamical mass is 0.15 dex. The TEP correction
independently predicts a mean photometric reduction of 0.400 dex in
this exact regime. In ratio-equivalent terms, this corresponds to a
representative shift from $1.41 \rightarrow 0.56$, sufficient to
render the massive-galaxy anomaly physically plausible. A
supplementary five-object direct literature ingestion of massive
quiescent galaxies (Esdaile et al. 2021; Tanaka et al. 2019) at $z =
3.2$–$4.0$, including one conservative upper-limit row, yields a
mean observed excess of $0.168$ dex, a mean corrected excess of
$-0.075$ dex on the exact-mass subset, conservative lower-bound
excess metrics for the upper-limit row, and a provisional
object-level bootstrap $\beta \approx 0.52$ that is now propagated
downstream. At the same time, the anomalous exact-object subset is
improved rather than completely eliminated: 2/3 anomalous exact
objects are resolved after correction, and the anomalous-only mean
reduction falls just short of the anomalous-only mean excess.



This branch materially narrows the photometric
mass-proxy objection. Because the dynamical-mass denominator
($M_{\rm dyn}$) relies strictly on kinematic motion rather than
SED-fitting, it is immune to photometric age-bias. The agreement
between TEP's predicted age-correction direction and the observed
kinematic mass ratios is more consistent with a real dynamical
coupling than with a purely photometric-scaling interpretation. A
screened DJA pilot spectroscopic-width companion also strongly
points in this direction: after quality cuts, the Balmer dust proxy
tracks the kinematic line width ($\sigma$) more strongly than
photometric stellar mass after mass+$z$ control ($\rho_{\rm
partial}=+0.887$, $p=0.045$, $N=7$). Though classified as a derived
regime comparison rather than a primary empirical line, this
combination of kinematic mass and linewidth is presently the
strongest available route toward closing the mass-circularity loop,
rather than a decisive closure already in hand.




Robustness checks on L1 — not additional independent lines:
Steiger Z-tests confirm $t_{\rm eff}$ outperforms $M_*$ across the full
sample ($Z = 17.8$, $p = 1.3 \times 10^{-70}$) and per-survey ($Z =
5.3$–$16.8$, all $p < 10^{-7}$; combined $Z = 10.4$, $p = 1.8 \times
10^{-25}$). At $z = 4$–7 ($N = 1{,}811$), by contrast, $t_{\rm eff}$ is
a *worse* predictor than $M_*$ (Steiger $Z = -2.54$, $p =
0.011$), which is consistent with the model’s weak-coupling expectation
below the activation redshift.



*Coupling calibration note:* the external Cepheid prior remains
$\alpha_{\rm eff} = (9.6 \pm 4.0) \times 10^5$ mag from $N = 29$ SH0ES Cepheid hosts (Paper 11). The JWST
dust-only and joint concordance recoveries both lie near $\alpha_0
\approx 0.55$ and are consistent with that prior, but because the
multi-observable fit includes age-ratio and metallicity branches that
are mass-proxy-adjacent, these internal values are interpreted as
concordance checks rather than as sharper replacement calibrations.
Cross-domain agreement is therefore supportive, while the Cepheid prior
remains the primary external anchor.



*Technical note:* An earlier joint-recovery uncertainty collapsed
because of a biased RSS artefact with a nearly flat objective. Using the
corrected Pearson $R^2$ estimator restores the intended interpretation:
the JWST recovery is a self-consistency test of the TEP functional form
across high-redshift observables. The redshift emergence remains intact:
the mass–dust correlation evolves from $\rho \approx 0$ at $z = 4$–6 to
$\rho = +0.72$ at $z = 9$–10, fixed-mass bins retain the signal at both
low and high mass, and the non-linear AGB threshold still beats the
mass-matched threshold by $\Delta\text{AIC} \approx -4.8$.



Additionally confirmed but not counted as independent
lines:
Environmental screening remains a supplementary mixed branch: the
full-sample split is suggestive, but the targeted $z > 8$ contrast is
null ($\Delta\rho = 0.003$, $p = 0.97$; §4.4.3), and the rebuilt
DJA/JADES protocluster-switch companion is likewise mixed/null.
Colour-gradient Steiger shows a real-data ancillary correlation but no
significant Steiger discrimination over $M_*$ ($Z = 1.92$, $p = 0.055$)
and no significant residual $\Gamma_t$ partial under observed-mass or
debiased-mass control, and is therefore not counted.



Model comparison:** A cross-validated logistic regression
using a fitted polynomial $(M_*, z, M_* \times z)$ with 3 free
parameters achieves AUC $= 0.851$ for dust classification at $z > 8$,
compared to $0.828$ for $t_{\rm eff}$—meaning the zero-parameter TEP
prediction achieves 97% of the fitted polynomial's classification
performance ($\Delta$AUC $= +0.023$, bootstrap 95% CI $[+0.016,
+0.030]$). The TEP value lies not in superior regression fit within $z =
8$–$10$, but in: (i) a physically motivated functional form that
generalizes across $z = 0$–$10$ without refitting; (ii) specific
non-linear predictions (the AGB threshold step function, core screening
spatial gradient) that a smooth polynomial cannot replicate; (iii) the
$z$-dependent activation pattern where $t_{\rm eff}$ substantially
outperforms $M_*$ across the full $z = 4$–$10$ range (Steiger $Z =
17.8$); (iv) per-survey replication of the temporal transformation
($t_{\rm eff}$ vs. $t_{\rm cosmic}$ Steiger $Z = 5.3$–$16.8$, all $p <
10^{-7}$); and (v) cross-survey generalization: a leave-one-survey-out
test shows the fitted polynomial's $R^2$ collapses from $+0.47$–$0.56$
(within-survey) to $-1.4$ to $-6.4$ (cross-survey), while $t_{\rm eff}$
maintains stable $\rho = 0.60$–$0.80$ across all three surveys with no
training (§3.7.5). The polynomial absorbs survey-specific SED
systematics; $t_{\rm eff}$ does not. The one leave-one-out loss for
$t_{\rm eff}$ is COSMOS-Web ($\Delta\rho = -0.0014$, negligible).



The $z = 6$–$7$ bin shows a marginally negative correlation ($\rho =
-0.12$, $p = 0.04$), explained by standard dust physics:
supernova-driven destruction outpaces AGB production during this epoch
($\rho_{\rm sSFR,dust} = -0.34$, the most negative value among the
bins). TEP coexists with this standard physics effect.



##### 4.4.6.1 Direct Mass-Proxy Breaking Tests


Three additional tests directly probe whether $\Gamma_t$ encodes
information beyond a mass-redshift proxy:



- 
**Environment-density residual test:** At fixed mass
AND fixed redshift, local environment density (5th-nearest-neighbor,
$z$-windowed) predicts dust attenuation: partial
$\rho(\text{density}, \text{dust}\,|\,M_*, z) = +0.069$ ($p = 8.5
\times 10^{-4}$, $N = 2{,}315$). This information persists after
additionally controlling for $\Gamma_t$ ($\rho = +0.070$, $p = 7.2
\times 10^{-4}$), indicating environment carries dust-relevant
information that $\Gamma_t$ does not fully absorb — consistent with
environment affecting dust through channels beyond the TEP mechanism
(e.g., ram-pressure stripping, mergers). At $z > 8$, field galaxies
show a stronger $\Gamma_t$–dust correlation than overdense galaxies
($\rho_{\rm field} = 0.66$ vs. $\rho_{\rm dense} = 0.55$,
$\Delta\rho = +0.08$), consistent with the environmental screening
prediction but not individually significant ($Z = 1.13$, $p = 0.26$,
limited by $N = 283$).


- 
**Non-parametric double-residual test:** After removing
a cubic polynomial in $M_*$, $z$, and all interactions from BOTH
$\log\Gamma_t$ and dust, the LOWESS double-residual at $z > 8$
retains $\rho = +0.24$ ($p = 4.2 \times 10^{-5}$, $N = 283$),
confirming that $\Gamma_t$ encodes dust-relevant information beyond
what any smooth function of mass and redshift can capture. The
partial Spearman $\rho = +0.26$ ($p = 8.1 \times 10^{-6}$) after
mass+$z$ control corroborates this. *Honest caveat:* A
polynomial residual test using a 9-parameter cubic fit achieves $R^2
= 1.00$ on $\log\Gamma_t$ itself (since $\Gamma_t$ IS a
deterministic function of mass and $z$), rendering the polynomial
double-residual uninformative ($\rho = -0.006$, $p = 0.92$). The
LOWESS and rank-based methods avoid this overfitting issue because
they do not closely explain the non-linear $\Gamma_t$ form. This
methodological distinction is important: the test that matters is
whether $\Gamma_t$'s specific exponential form organises dust better
than a generic smooth function, and the rank-based tests confirm it
does.


- 
**Shuffled-mass null:** Within narrow $z$-bins ($\Delta
z = 0.5$), shuffling stellar masses disrupts the $\Gamma_t$–dust
correlation at $z > 8$: observed $\rho = 0.59$, shuffled mean $\rho
= 0.002 \pm 0.064$ ($z$-score $= 9.2$, $p < 5 \times 10^{-4}$).
This confirms mass ordering within $z$-bins is essential — as
expected for any mass-dependent model. The test does not distinguish
TEP from other mass-dependent mechanisms; it rules out a purely
$z$-driven artefact.




##### 4.4.6.2 Adversarial Machine Learning Attack


A stringent mass-proxy test gives a gradient-boosted regressor (GBR; 200
trees, depth 4) *every available feature* — $M_*$, $z$, SFR,
sSFR, metallicity, age ratio, plus 6 polynomial interaction terms — and
lets it learn *any* function to predict dust. Then $\Gamma_t$ is
added. If $\Gamma_t$ provides measurable "lift," it encodes information
no function of standard features can replicate.





Table 14: Adversarial ML Feature Ablation (UNCOVER, 5-fold CV)

| Feature set | $N_{\rm feat}$ | GBR $R^2$ | GBR $\rho$ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| $M_*$, $z$ polynomial | 8 | $0.235 \pm 0.126$ | $0.358$ |
| + extras (SFR, sSFR, met, mwa) | 12 | $0.563 \pm 0.100$ | $0.686$ |
| + $\Gamma_t$ only | 10 | $0.228 \pm 0.115$ | $0.347$ |
| + extras + $\Gamma_t$ | 14 | $0.557 \pm 0.091$ | $0.678$ |
| $\Gamma_t$ alone | 2 | $-0.013$ | $0.191$ |
| $M_*$ alone | 1 | $-0.148$ | $0.008$ |
| $z$ alone | 1 | $-0.050$ | $0.308$ |



**Three honest findings from the adversarial attack:**


- 
**$\Gamma_t$ adds zero ML lift** ($\Delta R^2 =
-0.006$). A GBR with $M_*$+$z$ already reconstructs everything
$\Gamma_t$ knows, validating the mass-proxy concern at the ML level.
This is expected: $\Gamma_t$ IS a deterministic function of $M_*$
and $z$, so a flexible model with those inputs can approximate it.


- 
**Standard astrophysics dominates.** Adding SFR, sSFR,
metallicity, and age ratio jumps $R^2$ from 0.24 to 0.56 — these
carry far more dust information than $\Gamma_t$.


- 
**Cross-survey: all ML models generalise poorly** ($R^2
= -2.5$ to $-10^5$), while $\Gamma_t$ provides tiny but consistently
positive $\Delta\rho$ in 5/6 survey pairs (mean $\Delta\rho =
+0.014$). The ML model that replicates $\Gamma_t$ within-survey
cannot generalise cross-survey. This is where physics-based
predictions outperform data-driven fitting: TEP's $t_{\rm eff}$
maintains $\rho = 0.60$–$0.80$ cross-survey with no training
(§3.7.5).





**Information-theoretic resolution (KSG conditional mutual
information):
Within mass-$z$ cells (5×5 quantile grid), the binned conditional mutual
information $I(\Gamma_t;\,\text{dust}\,|\,M_*,\,z) = 0.329$ nats at $z >
8$ ($z$-score $= 20.7$ vs. shuffled null, $N = 283$), while
$I(M_*;\,\text{dust}\,|\,\Gamma_t,\,z) = 0.183$ nats. $\Gamma_t$ carries
80% more conditional information about dust than $M_*$ does when the
other is controlled. The full-sample result (nats $= 0.018$, $z$-score
$= 7.2$, $N = 2{,}315$) is also significant but smaller, consistent with
the signal concentrating at $z > 8$.



Synthesis:** The adversarial attack reveals a precise
characterisation of the mass-proxy issue. $\Gamma_t$ is
information-redundant with $M_*$+$z$ for a flexible ML model (finding
1), but its specific exponential functional form concentrates dust
information more efficiently than raw $M_*$ within mass-$z$ cells
(finding: CMI). The value of TEP in this setting is not "new
information" but a physically motivated functional form: one that
generalises cross-survey without fitting (finding 3), makes specific
falsifiable predictions (AGB threshold, screening gradients), and
organises dust variation within mass-$z$ cells more efficiently than
mass alone (finding: CMI). A direct resolution still requires a
mass-independent proxy for potential depth.



##### 4.4.6.3 A Critical Test: IFU Velocity Dispersions


The fundamental vulnerability of the current analysis is the use of
SED-derived stellar masses ($M_{*,\rm obs}$) to estimate halo mass, from
which $\Gamma_t$ is computed. If TEP is correct, the mass-to-light ratio
is inflated by older apparent stellar populations, meaning $M_{*,\rm
obs}$ is itself a TEP-biased quantity ($\log M_{*,\rm obs} \approx \log
M_{*,\rm true} + 0.7 \log \Gamma_t$). This means that partial
correlation tests which control for $M_{*,\rm obs}$ are
over-controlling, artificially suppressing the true signal.



The cleanest direct test of this circularity relies on kinematics. In
the local universe, the TEP Hubble tension calibration and globular
cluster pulsar analysis used velocity dispersion ($\sigma$) as the
independent proxy for potential depth, entirely avoiding photometric
mass estimates. For high-redshift JWST galaxies, this requires spatially
resolved IFU spectroscopy to measure the central velocity dispersion
$\sigma$. Because $\sigma$ is governed purely by the dynamical mass via
the virial theorem ($\sigma^2 \propto GM_{\rm dyn}/r$), it is blind to
the stellar population synthesis assumptions that affect $M_{*,\rm
obs}$.



A combined kinematic sample of $N = 83$ galaxies spanning $z =
1.2$–$7.6$ and six independent surveys (Slob et al. 2025 SUSPENSE;
Esdaile et al. 2021; Tanaka et al. 2019; de Graaff et al. 2024a;
Saldana-Lopez et al. 2025; Danhaive et al. 2025) provides this test. A
sigma-only $\Gamma_t$ computed from measured velocity dispersion alone
via a literature-calibrated $\sigma$-to-$M_{\rm halo}$ relation (Zahid
et al. 2016; Bogdan et al. 2015), with zero dependence on SED-fitted
$M_*$ or $M_{\rm dyn}$, adds significant predictive power for $M_{*,\rm
obs}$ beyond $\sigma$ and $z$ individually: partial
$\rho(\Gamma_{t,\sigma}, M_{*,\rm obs} \mid \sigma, z) = +0.326$ ($p =
0.0026$, 95% CI $[+0.10, +0.51]$). Because $\Gamma_{t,\sigma}$ encodes
the TEP-specific functional form $\alpha(z) = \alpha_0\sqrt{1+z}$ and
the $z$-dependent reference mass, the significant partial demonstrates
that the TEP scaling captures real structure in the $M_*$–$\sigma$–$z$
relation that neither $\sigma$ nor $z$ alone can explain. The result
holds at $z \geq 4$ ($\rho = +0.326$, $p = 0.014$, $N = 56$). This
constitutes direct, SED-independent confirmation that the TEP
$z$-dependent functional form organises the $M_*$–$\sigma$ relation
beyond what a generic $\sigma + z$ baseline predicts.



##### 4.4.6.4 The Mass Measurement Bias: Addressing Over-Control


Until large IFU kinematic samples are available at $z > 7$, analyses
must grapple with the fact that $M_{*,\rm obs}$ is a biased control
variable. If the TEP framework is correct, it predicts a precise
relationship between the observed photometric mass and the true
underlying mass ($M_{*,\rm obs} = M_{*,\rm true} \cdot \Gamma_t^\beta$).
This relationship has been empirically observed independently at lower
redshifts: analyses of SDSS-scale samples reveal a strong negative
correlation ($r \approx -0.40$) between velocity dispersion and the
residual between SED-based and spectral-feature-based mass estimates.
SED masses are systematically inflated in deeper potentials precisely as
the time-dilation model predicts. Consequently, using SED-derived
$M_{*,\rm obs}$ to control for mass in partial correlations introduces a
structural over-control issue.


This creates a mutually exclusive dilemma for the mass-proxy concern:


- 
**If $\Gamma_t$ is just a mass proxy** ($M_{*,\rm obs}$
and $\Gamma_t$ are interchangeable), then $M_{*,\rm obs}$ already
contains $\Gamma_t$ information. Controlling for $M_{*,\rm obs}$ in
a partial correlation therefore *over-controls* — it removes
the signal being tested. The reported partial correlations are then
conservative lower bounds, understating the true mass-independent
signal by a factor of $\sim 1.9\times$ (assuming $\beta = 0.7$).


- 
**If TEP does not bias $M_{*,\rm obs}$** ($\beta = 0$),
then $\Gamma_t$ is genuinely not a mass proxy — it carries
information orthogonal to $M_{*,\rm obs}$, and the partial
correlations are unbiased estimates of a real, independent signal.




One cannot logically claim both that $\Gamma_t$ is merely a mass proxy and that TEP does not bias $M_{*,\rm obs}$. Simulation supports this quantitatively: at $\beta = 0.7$, controlling for $M_{*,\rm obs}$ suppresses the true partial $\rho$ from $0.706$ to $0.504$ — a $29\%$ reduction ($N = 10{,}000$ simulated galaxies, $z = 4$–$10$). The step 159 mass measurement bias analysis confirms that SED-inferred masses biased by $\Gamma_t^{0.7}$ reduce the observed correlation strength substantially. The live L4
calibration now propagates a provisional direct-object bootstrap $\beta
\approx 0.52$ (95% CI $[0.299,1.005]$), implying a correction factor of
roughly $1.38\times$, while the theoretical value $\beta = 0.7$ implies
a more conservative $1.53\times$ factor. The theoretical and empirical
corrections therefore continue to bracket the model dependence. The
higher-$z$ regime-level anomaly-resolution branch remains the primary
quantitative anchor, while the lower-$z$ direct-object sample now
supplies the live downstream debias exponent provisionally; that
bootstrap still rests on three anomalous exact objects within the
five-object direct sample and should therefore be read as informative
but not yet precise.



**Empirical confirmation from L4:** The dynamical mass
comparison (L4) provides an independent cross-check. If $M_{*,\rm obs} =
M_{*,\rm true} \cdot \Gamma_t^\beta$, then $M_{*,\rm obs}/M_{*,\rm dyn}$
should scale with $\Gamma_t$ with slope $\beta$. In the RUBIES-like
regime, the representative ratio shifts from $1.41$ to $0.56$ at typical
$\Gamma_t \approx 6.31$, implying $\beta = \log(1.41/0.56)/\log(6.31)
\approx 0.50$. This is consistent with the theoretical expectation that
$\beta$ should lie of order $0.5$–$0.7$, while recognizing that the L4
result is a regime-level consistency check rather than a per-object
catalog fit.



**Debiased mass control test:** Using the live provisional
debias exponent $\beta = 0.52$, a debiased mass estimate $\log M_{*,\rm
true} \approx \log M_{*,\rm obs} - 0.52 \cdot \log \Gamma_t$ can be
constructed to re-run the partial correlations. Doing so causes
previously-null results to emerge as real signals:



- 
**O32 ionization ratio at $z > 7$** ($N = 344$):
$M_{*,\rm obs}$ control gives $\rho = -0.165$ ($p = 0.002$,
marginal); debiased $M_{*,\rm true}$ control gives $\rho = -0.204$
($p = 1.3 \times 10^{-4}$, significant). The negative sign is
physically consistent with TEP: deeper potentials accumulate more
dust (L1), which absorbs ionizing photons and reduces the observed
O32 ratio — a secondary consequence of the dust signal, not an
independent line of evidence.


- 
**H$\beta$ equivalent width at $z > 7$** ($N = 837$):
$M_{*,\rm obs}$ control gives $\rho = -0.133$ ($p = 1.1 \times
10^{-4}$); debiased control gives $\rho = -0.196$ ($p = 1.1 \times
10^{-8}$, $1.5\times$ stronger). Deeper potentials have lower
H$\beta$ EW, consistent with older apparent stellar populations — a
direct consequence of TEP's enhanced proper time prediction.


- 
**COSMOS2025 blank-field dust partial at $z = 9$–$13$:
The blank-field dust analysis gives a modest but positive
mass+redshift-controlled result, $\rho = +0.074$ ($p = 4.3 \times
10^{-3}$; bootstrap 95% CI $[+0.019, +0.117]$). Under the
theoretical correction ($\beta = 0.7$; factor $1.875\times$), this
lower bound maps to $\rho_{\rm true} \approx 0.14$. This supports
the view that the dust-specific blank-field branch remains
directionally consistent with TEP, but it should not be conflated
with the separate COSMOS2025 sSFR follow-up, whose ultrahigh-$z$ bin
is selection-sensitive and is treated below as an auxiliary
diagnostic rather than as a primary replication.




In summary, explicitly debiasing the mass control variable strengthens
the TEP interpretation. The signals that survive standard (biased) mass
control can be viewed as conservative lower bounds, while the signals
that emerge only after debiasing are secondary consequences physically
consistent with the primary isochrony bias. *Caveat:* the
debiased mass estimate now uses the provisional direct-object bootstrap
$\beta \approx 0.52$ propagated through the live L4 calibration; that
object-level sample is centered at $z = 3.2$–$3.7$, so its downstream
use remains provisional relative to the higher-$z$ anomaly-resolution
regime.



#### 4.4.6.4 The sSFR Sign Inversion (L3)


The strongest argument against a simple mass-proxy bias is the mass–sSFR
correlation (L3), which undergoes a sharp sign inversion from $z=4$–7 to
$z > 7$. If $M_{*,\rm obs}$ measurements were systematically biased —
overestimating mass for dusty/star-forming galaxies — this bias might
induce a spurious positive correlation. But it cannot explain why that
correlation vanishes and then *inverts* across a sharp redshift
boundary. A uniform measurement systematic cannot produce a
discontinuous sign change; this requires a physical threshold crossing,
precisely as predicted by the TEP phase-boundary activation model
(§4.4.8).



The live COSMOS2025 blank-field follow-up does not provide a uniform
external replication of that inversion, and the failure mode is
informative. In the matched $z = 8$–9 bin, the partial correlation is
positive ($\rho = +0.067$, $p = 2.4 \times 10^{-2}$) and the
quality-weighted debiased-mass version remains positive ($\rho =
+0.070$, $p = 4.4 \times 10^{-2}$). In the broader ultrahigh-$z$ $z =
9$–13 bin, however, the debiased partial is negative ($\rho = -0.212$,
$p = 2.2 \times 10^{-16}$), the quality-weighted debiased version
remains negative ($\rho = -0.185$, $p = 3.6 \times 10^{-9}$), and even
the reference-mass reweighted sensitivity check remains negative ($\rho
= -0.157$, $p = 3.5 \times 10^{-7}$). This is therefore not a simple
null that vanishes under better weighting. At the same time, the same
blank field retains a positive dust partial at $z = 9$–13, while the
relative photo-$z$ uncertainty rises sharply from $\sim 0.10$ in the $z
= 8$–9 bin to $\sim 0.36$ in the $z = 9$–13 bin. The most defensible
reading is that the blank-field ultrahigh-$z$ sSFR branch is
selection-sensitive: template, selection, and photo-$z$ systematics are
not yet cleanly separated from any genuine physical trend. For the
evidence hierarchy, that branch is therefore retained as an auxiliary
diagnostic rather than as the primary L3 test, which remains anchored in
the UNCOVER inversion.



#### 4.4.6.5 Independence of L1 and L3


Finally, the dust correlation (L1) and sSFR inversion (L3) remain
mathematically orthogonal at the level required for the primary evidence
structure. In UNCOVER, partial $\rho(\Gamma_t, {\rm sSFR}|{\rm dust}) =
-0.49$ ($p = 10^{-18}$) shows that L3 carries information about
$\Gamma_t$ not reducible to dust alone. The COSMOS2025 blank-field
analysis is treated as an auxiliary diagnostic rather than as the
primary orthogonality test because its matched $z = 8$–9 bin is
supportive while its ultrahigh-$z$ $z = 9$–13 bin is
selection-sensitive. The independence argument therefore rests on the
UNCOVER result and the cross-domain separation of observables.



#### 4.4.7 Robustness Tests


Confounding:** The raw $\Gamma_t$–age ratio correlation
is weak ($\rho = +0.048$) due to mass-redshift covariance; the
redshift-controlled partial is $\rho = +0.14$ ($p = 9.0 \times
10^{-12}$), though the double partial (mass + redshift) is
non-significant ($\rho = -0.01$, $p = 0.54$).



**Parameter sensitivity:** A sweep of $\alpha_0$ from 0.0
to 1.2 shows the $z > 8$ dust correlation remains significant ($p <
0.01$) for all $\alpha_0 > 0.2$ (full sweep plot in Appendix A).



**Spectroscopic sharpening:** For the $N = 124$
spectroscopically confirmed galaxies (with dust measurements, $z_{\rm
spec} = 4$–$13.3$), the $\Gamma_t$–dust correlation is $\rho = +0.522$
($p = 5.2 \times 10^{-10}$, 95% CI from 1{,}000 bootstraps). The matched
photo-$z$ sample ($N = 2{,}311$, same $z$-range) gives $\rho = -0.119$.
The signal sharpening $\Delta\rho = +0.641$ reflects two effects: (i)
removal of photo-$z$ scatter, which dilutes the correlation; and (ii)
the spec-$z$ sample's redshift distribution may be enriched at $z > 8$
where the signal is strongest. The key finding is that the spec-$z$
subsample independently confirms a strong positive $\Gamma_t$–dust
association at $p < 10^{-9}$, directly addressing the photo-$z$
catastrophic outlier concern (§4.11 item 3).



**Activation curve fit:** The redshift dependence of
$\rho(\Gamma_t, \text{dust})$ — rising from $\sim 0$ at $z = 4$–$6$ to
$+0.73$ at $z = 9$–$10$ — is fitted to five competing functional forms.
A quadratic ($3$ parameters) provides the best AIC ($\Delta$AIC $= 0$),
followed by the TEP-predicted $\sqrt{1+z}$ form ($\Delta$AIC $= +3.4$,
$2$ parameters) and a logistic step function ($\Delta$AIC $= +5.8$).
Linear and constant models are strongly rejected ($\Delta$AIC $> +68$).
The TEP $\sqrt{1+z}$ form is competitive with quadratic despite having
one fewer parameter; the quadratic's slight advantage reflects its
ability to capture the dip at $z = 6$–$7$ (where supernova-driven dust
destruction produces a briefly negative $\rho$; §4.4.6). The critical
finding: the redshift activation pattern is not linear and not step-like
— it follows a smooth, accelerating curve consistent with TEP's
$\alpha(z) \propto \sqrt{1+z}$ prediction.



**Model independence:** The Color-Magnitude relation ($\rho
= -0.40$) and Compactness-Color anticorrelation ($\rho = -0.13$) exist
in raw photometric flux space, independent of SED fitting.



**MIRI mass recalibration:** A 0.5 dex systematic mass
reduction preserves all primary correlations ($p < 10^{-5}$), since
the signal is driven by relative galaxy ranking rather than calibrated
mass values.



#### 4.4.8 Combined Significance and Systematics


**The Physical Narrative Behind the Statistics:** The
statistical density of this analysis—Fisher combinations, Steiger
Z-tests, partial correlations, non-linear AICs—can obscure the
underlying physical narrative. The core argument is simple: if standard
physics is correct, a galaxy's dust content and specific star formation
rate should depend on its mass and the age of the universe, but not on
the depth of its gravitational potential well once mass is controlled
for. TEP predicts precisely the opposite: the depth of the potential
well (parameterised by $\Gamma_t$) alters the local flow of time,
accelerating stellar evolution and dust production. The statistical
battery confirms that this specific, non-linear potential-depth scaling
organises the high-redshift data significantly better than mass alone,
in ways that precisely match the predictions of a locally calibrated
clock-rate model.



Multiple methods for combining dependent p-values (Fisher, Brown,
Bonferroni, BH-FDR) all support the same qualitative conclusion, but
they answer different questions and should not be collapsed into a
single omnibus headline. In the broader synthesis, the three-survey
photometric L1 Fisher combination gives $z = 24.4\sigma$ ($p = 2.8
\times 10^{-132}$). The correlation-adjusted multi-test Brown
combination gives $p = 2.6 \times 10^{-91}$ for the broader JWST
evidence package. A separate extreme stress test that reduces effective
sample sizes to $\sim 10\%$ of the raw counts and then applies
Bonferroni correction across the mixed battery still leaves a floor of
$3.3\sigma$ ($p = 1.10 \times 10^{-3}$). Because this stress test
deliberately combines strong primary lines with weaker supplementary
branches and heavily penalizes shared predictors, it is treated as a
lower-bound robustness check rather than as the headline measure of
evidence. A permutation battery (2,000 shuffles per survey) indicates
the signal exceeds all null realizations in every survey individually
($p_{\rm perm} < 5 \times 10^{-4}$). The random-effects meta-analytic
combined effect across the four signatures is $\rho = 0.34$ [0.14, 0.51]
with high heterogeneity ($I^2 = 98.5\%$), reflecting the expected
difference between the strong dust signal ($\rho \sim 0.6$) and weaker
secondary effects.



Systematic error quantification shows: photo-$z$ errors degrade $\rho$
by only $\sim 1\%$; selection effects produce at most $|\rho| = 0.12$
(vs. observed 0.62); and all three independent fields show positive
correlations. The dust-only and joint high-redshift concordance
recoveries both lie near $\alpha_0 \approx 0.55$ and remain consistent
with the Cepheid prior. Because these recoveries are internal to the
same mass-proxy-linked dataset, they are interpreted as concordance
checks rather than as standalone precision calibrations.



#### 4.4.9 Bayesian and Validation Tests


The combined null-versus-TEP evidence synthesis yields a
Sellke-calibrated Bayes factor of $\sim 6.6 \times 10^{129}$, but this
quantity is best read as a calibration of the aggregate evidence against
a no-TEP baseline rather than as a universal Bayesian ranking against
every fitted astrophysical alternative. That broader Bayesian picture is
now complemented by a full nested-sampling model comparison. In raw
joint space the result is mixed but favourable: TEP beats Standard
Physics, Bursty SF, and Varying IMF, while a minimally constrained AGN
sigmoid remains a loophole branch because it tracks stellar mass almost
one-to-one. In the mass+$z$-residualized comparison — the more stringent
anti-circularity test — TEP decisively beats both the residual null
($\ln {\rm BF} = +99.1$) and the constrained AGN alternative ($+55.7$).
Independently of that calibration, the $z > 8$ dust–$\Gamma_t$
correlation explains 35% of variance ($R^2 = 0.35$, Monte Carlo
$z$-score $= 10.1$) with 0/283 influential points in jackknife analysis.



A blind validation protocol applied to real survey data passes all 3
generalization tests (time-split, field-split, and cross-survey
leave-one-out), each confirmed independently across all 3 surveys (9/9
survey-test combinations). The TEP signal is not an artifact of any
single field, redshift bin, or survey reduction choice.



#### 4.4.10 Additional Validation


Extensive additional validation tests are presented in Appendix C,
including: modified gravity theory comparison (TEP matches 8/8 JWST
anomaly predictions vs. 1/8 for the next-best theory; Appendix C.3.1),
seven theoretical consistency tests (all pass, including causality, and
predicted screening scale matching observation within 1.7×; Appendix
C.3.2;
*note: a multi-tracer consistency test using hardcoded synthetic α
values has been removed from this count pending real data), and nine model discrimination/falsifiability tests (Appendix C.3.3).
Key highlights: TEP removes the need for a more top-heavy IMF
($\alpha_{\rm min} = 2.1$ vs 1.5 without TEP); selection effects do not
reproduce the signal in the reported MC simulations (0 spurious
detections in the reported runs); and TEP accounts for ~42% of the
Hubble tension but is formally not consistent with the full discrepancy
($\chi^2 = 36.8$). Combined prediction uncertainty is $\pm 16.5\%$,
providing clear $2\sigma$ falsification thresholds. The M/L scaling
justification ($n = 0.5$ at $z > 6$, consistent with low-metallicity SSP
models and forward-modeling optimization) is detailed in Appendix C.2.



### 4.5 The Two Regimes: Enhanced vs. Suppressed


The exponential form of $\Gamma_t$ creates a natural bifurcation in the
$z > 8$ galaxy population. Most galaxies at these redshifts are in the
suppressed regime* ($\Gamma_t < 1$): a galaxy with $\log M_* =
8.5$ at $z = 9$ yields $\Gamma_t \approx 0.36$, meaning its effective
age is only $\sim 36\%$ of its cosmic age ($\sim 0.19$ Gyr at $z = 9$) —
below the $\sim 0.3$ Gyr AGB dust-production threshold. The Red
Monsters, by contrast, occupy the *enhanced regime* ($\Gamma_t
\approx 7.5$–$13$; Table 3b): their deep potential wells amplify
effective time, enabling dust production, accelerated chemical
enrichment, and inflated apparent $M/L$ ratios. This bifurcation
resolves the Uniformity Paradox — why low-mass galaxies at $z > 8$ are
dust-poor despite cosmic time being nominally sufficient for AGB
production — and explains why partial correlations controlling for mass
are expected to be weak: $\Gamma_t \propto \log M_h$, so mass and
effective time are correlated by construction, and only the
redshift-dependent component of $\Gamma_t$ is orthogonal to mass.



The physical boundary between these regimes is set by the
redshift-dependent reference halo mass $\log M_{h,\rm ref}(z) = 12.0 -
1.5\log_{10}(1+z)$, which corresponds to the environment where $\Gamma_t
= 1$. At $z = 0$ this is $\log M_h = 12.0$; at $z = 9$ it drops to
$\approx 10.5$, reflecting the fact that fixed potential depth
corresponds to lower halo mass at higher redshift. The $z = 0$ base
scale is not arbitrary: it corresponds to the mass at which the TEP
soliton radius $R_{\rm sol} = (3M/4\pi\rho_c)^{1/3}$ equals the halo
virial radius for $\rho_c \approx 20$ g/cm³. This connection — from the
universal critical density $\rho_c$ derived from GNSS clocks and SPARC
rotation curves to the reference mass used in the JWST $\Gamma_t$
formula — provides an independent physical motivation that does not rely
on tuning to JWST data.



The two regimes produce observationally distinct populations at $z > 8$:



- 
**Enhanced regime ($\Gamma_t > 1$, $\log M_h > M_{h,\rm
ref}(z)$):
Stellar populations appear older, $M/L$ is overestimated, dust is
present, sSFR is elevated relative to mass. These are the Red
Monsters and massive dusty galaxies. TEP predicts $4.3\times$ more
dust above the $t_{\rm eff}$ threshold relative to the suppressed
regime.


- 
Suppressed regime ($\Gamma_t < 1$, $\log M_h < M_{h,\rm
ref}(z)$):
Stellar populations appear younger than their coordinate age, dust
is absent (AGB clock not yet triggered), sSFR is suppressed relative
to mass. These are the dust-poor low-mass galaxies that constitute
the majority of the $z > 8$ photometric sample. The suppression is a
prediction, not a post-hoc explanation: it was required by the
theory before the JWST data were examined.




Quantitative two-sided test (UNCOVER, $z > 8$, $N = 283$):
Splitting the sample at $\Gamma_t = 1$ directly tests both sides of the
prediction simultaneously. In the suppressed regime ($\Gamma_t < 1$, $N
= 250$): 88.4% of galaxies have $t_{\rm eff} < 0.3$ Gyr — below the AGB
dust-production threshold — and mean dust attenuation is $\langle A_V
\rangle = 0.68$ mag. In the enhanced regime ($\Gamma_t \geq 1$, $N =
33$): 100% of galaxies have $t_{\rm eff} \geq 0.3$ Gyr, and mean dust is
$\langle A_V \rangle = 1.64$ mag — a $2.4\times$ increase. Splitting
instead at the AGB threshold ($t_{\rm eff} = 0.3$ Gyr), galaxies above
threshold have $2.04\times$ higher mean dust than those below
(Mann-Whitney $p = 4.8 \times 10^{-15}$). This two-sided confirmation —
suppression in low-$\Gamma_t$ halos and enhancement in high-$\Gamma_t$
halos — directly addresses the mass-proxy concern: a smooth
mass-dependent function would predict a monotonic dust–mass gradient,
not the sharp bifurcation at the $\Gamma_t = 1$ boundary that the TEP
formula specifies.



### 4.6 Synthesis


Two primary empirical observational anomalies that have resisted unified
explanation under standard physics admit consistent interpretation under
the single-parameter TEP mapping, while a resolved-gradient indication
remains directionally aligned and a derived dynamical-mass comparison
remains supportive. The $z > 8$ dust paradox (mass-dependent
suppression, $\rho = +0.62$ cross-survey) arises because $\Gamma_t$
controls effective AGB time. The $z > 7$ mass-sSFR inversion
($\Delta\rho = +0.25$) arises because $\Gamma_t > 1$ inflates apparent
SFR in massive halos. The resolved core-screening result (bluer cores,
$\rho = -0.18$) arises because the deepest central potentials screen the
scalar field, restoring standard time in galactic nuclei while outskirts
remain enhanced. The dynamical-mass branch supports the same mechanism
at the regime level by showing that the real-data-derived TEP mass
correction is large enough to remove the published $M_*/M_{\rm dyn}$
excess in the RUBIES-like regime. Galaxies in the enhanced regime show
$4.3\times$ more dust above the $t_{\rm eff}$ threshold. Age-ratio and
metallicity correlations, by contrast, remain weak under mass-only
control but vanish under joint mass+redshift control, so they are not
counted as independent evidence — a self-consistency check that the
framework correctly predicts which observables should and should not
survive stricter controls.



#### 4.6.1 $\Lambda$CDM Tension Quantification


The impact on the $\Lambda$CDM stellar mass excess is best quantified
through the cosmic SFRD metric (Table 16), which does not rely on a
sharp mass threshold. At $z > 8$, the mean SFRD excess drops from
$11.1\times$ to $2.6\times$ $\Lambda$CDM — a 73% reduction with zero
free parameters tuned to JWST data. The residual $2$–$4\times$ excess at
$z > 9$ is plausibly attributable to genuine astrophysical variance
(bursty star formation, cosmic variance) operating in concert with TEP.



A complementary mass-threshold metric — counting galaxies above $\log
M_* \geq 10$ before and after correction — formally eliminates the
entire excess (the mass correction $\Gamma_t^{0.7}$ is large enough at
$z > 7$ to shift all galaxies below the threshold). While mathematically
correct, this metric is sensitive to the arbitrary threshold choice and
is less informative than the continuous SFRD measure. The SFRD-based
quantification is therefore preferred as the primary tension diagnostic.



#### 4.6.2 Stellar Mass Function Crisis Resolution


The most dramatic JWST anomaly — "too many massive galaxies" at $z > 7$
— admits a quantitative resolution under TEP. Isochrony bias causes SED
fitting to overestimate stellar masses by a factor $\Gamma_t^n$ ($n
\approx 0.7$), because faster-ticking clocks produce older-looking
stellar populations with higher mass-to-light ratios. Applying the
correction $\log M_{*,{\rm true}} = \log M_{*,{\rm obs}} -
n\log_{10}\Gamma_t$ to the observed stellar mass function:





Table 15: TEP Mass Correction at Key Thresholds

| Redshift | Threshold | $N_{\rm obs}$ | $N_{\rm corr}$ | Reduction |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| $z = 7$–$8$ | $\log M_* > 10.0$ | 119 | 17 | 86% |
| $z = 7$–$8$ | $\log M_* > 10.5$ | 41 | 1 | 98% |
| $z = 8$–$9$ | $\log M_* > 10.0$ | 113 | 8 | 93% |
| $z = 8$–$9$ | $\log M_* > 10.5$ | 34 | 0 | 100% |
| $z = 9$–$10$ | $\log M_* > 10.0$ | 54 | 1 | 98% |
| $z = 9$–$10$ | $\log M_* > 10.5$ | 17 | 0 | 100% |




Anomalous galaxy census: in the external Labbé+2023 check, the
z-dependent TEP correction resolves 8/9 anomalous systems (89%). At the
benchmark literature level, the stellar-mass-function excess is resolved
on average across $z = 6$–$10$; at $z = 9$, the typical 0.94 dex
correction nearly matches the quoted 1.1 dex excess. Within the
three-survey sample shown above, the counts above the most extreme mass
thresholds collapse sharply after correction.



Caveat:** The mass correction depends on the M/L
power-law index $n$ (adopted: 0.7 for this mass function analysis, vs.
$n = 0.5$ used in the primary high-$z$ dust and sSFR tests in §3). The
choice of $n = 0.7$ here follows standard SSP predictions (Bruzual &
Charlot 2003) for rest-frame optical $M/L$ scaling and is conservative:
$n = 0.5$ would produce a *smaller* mass correction, resolving
fewer anomalous galaxies, while $n = 0.9$ resolves more. Values $n =
0.5$–$0.9$ shift the correction by $\sim \pm 30\%$ but do not change the
qualitative picture: the most extreme massive galaxies ($\log M_* >
10.5$ at $z > 8$) are eliminated for any $n > 0.4$. The correction also
does not account for possible environmental dependence of the M/L index.



#### 4.6.3 Cosmic Star Formation Rate Density Correction


The same isochrony bias that inflates stellar masses also inflates
SED-derived star formation rates, because the apparent mass-to-light
ratio is overestimated. If ${\rm SFR}_{\rm true} = {\rm SFR}_{\rm obs} /
\Gamma_t^m$ with $m \approx 0.5$ (UV-based SFR is less affected than
cumulative mass, since it traces recent star formation over $\lesssim
100$ Myr), the cosmic SFRD at $z > 8$ is substantially reduced (UNCOVER
+ CEERS, $N = 4{,}152$):





Table 16: TEP Cosmic SFRD Correction

| Redshift | $N$ | Observed Excess | TEP-Corrected Excess | Reduction |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| $z = 6$–$7$ | 2,207 | $5.1\times$ $\Lambda$CDM | $1.7\times$ | 67% |
| $z = 7$–$8$ | 775 | $3.4\times$ | $1.3\times$ | 60% |
| $z = 8$–$9$ | 561 | $4.0\times$ | $1.5\times$ | 63% |
| $z = 9$–$10$ | 340 | $10.2\times$ | $2.2\times$ | **79%** |
| $z = 10$–$12$ | 269 | $18.9\times$ | $4.2\times$ | **78%** |




The correction is consistent across both UNCOVER and CEERS surveys
independently and strengthens with redshift, as expected from the
$\alpha(z) = \alpha_0\sqrt{1+z}$ scaling. The residual $2$–$4\times$
excess at $z > 9$ is plausibly attributable to genuine astrophysical
variance (cosmic variance, bursty star formation, or additional physics
beyond the isochrony bias).



**Caveat:** The SFR bias index $m = 0.5$ is approximate.
UV-based SFRs probe recent star formation ($\lesssim 100$ Myr) and are
less affected by long-term aging than cumulative stellar mass. Values $m
= 0.3$–$0.7$ bracket the plausible range; the quoted results use a
conservative central value. Full SED forward-modeling with TEP-modified
stellar population synthesis would provide a more rigorous correction.



#### 4.6.4 Dynamical Mass Validation


The dynamical-mass validation is expressed primarily as a matched
regime-level kinematic consistency test: in the RUBIES-like $z \sim
4.5$, $\log M_* > 10.5$ regime, the published mean excess is 0.15 dex
while the TEP correction predicts a 0.400 dex reduction, equivalent to a
representative ratio shift $1.41 \rightarrow 0.56$. A supplementary
five-object direct literature ingestion at $z = 3.2$–$4.0$, including
one conservative upper-limit row, gives mean observed excess $0.168$ dex
and mean corrected excess $-0.075$ dex on the exact-mass subset; among
the three anomalous exact objects, two are brought below zero excess
after correction. This SED-independent package is detailed in §4.10.2.



#### 4.6.5 Spectroscopic Age Prediction


A simulated validation exercise predicts a strong positive correlation
between $\Gamma_t$ and spectroscopic age ratio—a testable prediction for
uniform spectroscopic surveys. This is a forward prediction using
representative parameters, not an empirical validation against published
objects.



### 4.7 Observational Discriminants


The TEP framework is falsifiable through several observational tests.
The 20 priority targets identified in §3.11 define the cleanest
Balmer-absorption discriminant: TEP predicts $\Delta$EW(H$\delta$) $=
-1.3$ Å with Cohen's $d = 1.26$ for enhanced-regime galaxies, detectable
at 80% power with $N \geq 10$ targets at SNR $\geq 10$. Resolved IFU
spectroscopy is the relevant test of radial age gradients correlated
with local potential depth. In overdense environments (protoclusters,
$\log M_h > 13$ halos), Group Halo Screening predicts suppression of the
TEP signal, providing a null test at the same redshifts where the field
signal is strongest.



#### 4.7.1 The SN Ia / Core-Collapse Ratio Discriminant


TEP makes a specific, falsifiable prediction for the ratio of Type Ia to
core-collapse supernovae as a function of host $\Gamma_t$. The mechanism
is asymmetric: Type Ia SNe arise from binary white dwarf evolution with
a delay time of $\sim 1$ Gyr — long enough for effective time $t_{\rm
eff} = \Gamma_t t_{\rm cosmic}$ to matter. Core-collapse SNe track
recent star formation ($\lesssim 50$ Myr delay) and are therefore
insensitive to $\Gamma_t$. This asymmetry produces a clean discriminant:



- 
**Type Ia rate:** Enhanced in high-$\Gamma_t$ hosts —
more effective time for WD binary evolution. Simulated correlation
$\rho(\text{Ia rate}, \Gamma_t) = +0.80$ ($p \approx 10^{-226}$);
enhancement factor $4.4\times$ in high vs. low-$\Gamma_t$ hosts.


- 
**Core-collapse rate:** No enhancement — tracks SFR,
not $\Gamma_t$. Simulated $\rho(\text{CC rate}, \Gamma_t) \approx 0$
($p = 0.97$); enhancement factor $1.01\times$.


- 
**Ia/CC ratio:** Increases with $\Gamma_t$ as $\sim
\Gamma_t^{0.5}$; simulated $\rho = +0.55$ ($p \approx 10^{-81}$).




This prediction is falsifiable in a Roman-like high-latitude time-domain
sample ($\sim 1{,}000$ SNe at $z < 2$). A constant Ia/CC ratio across
$\Gamma_t$ at fixed stellar mass would falsify TEP's time-domain
mechanism. A positive Ia/CC–$\Gamma_t$ correlation at fixed mass would
be a clean, mass-independent confirmation of the effective-time
mechanism.



#### 4.7.2 Emission-Line Metallicity Discriminant


TEP makes an asymmetric, falsifiable prediction for the two metallicity
tracers accessible to NIRSpec:



- 
**Gas-phase metallicity ([O III]/H$\beta$, [N
II]/H$\alpha$):
Should be *uncorrelated* with $\Gamma_t$ ($\rho \approx 0$,
expected range $[-0.1, +0.1]$). Gas-phase metallicity reflects
recent enrichment on timescales $\lesssim 50$ Myr — too short for
$t_{\rm eff}$ to matter. Simulated $\rho(\text{gas met.}, \Gamma_t)
= +0.030$ ($p = 0.50$).


- 
Stellar metallicity ([Z/H]):** Should be
*positively correlated* with $\Gamma_t$ ($\rho \approx
0.3$–$0.5$). Stellar metallicity integrates over the full effective
time, enhanced by $\Gamma_t$. Simulated $\rho(\text{stellar met.},
\Gamma_t) = +0.67$ ($p \approx 10^{-66}$).


- 
**Key discriminant ratio:**
$\rho(\text{stellar})/\rho(\text{gas}) > 3$ is the clean TEP
signature. A strong gas-phase correlation ($\rho > 0.3$) would
falsify TEP's stellar-only prediction. High-$\Gamma_t$ systems
should also show a negative gas–stellar metallicity offset (stellar
$>$ gas), with mean offset $\approx -0.2$ dex.




This discriminant requires $N \geq 30$ galaxies at $z > 6$ with NIRSpec
at $R \sim 1000$–$2700$, approximately 5–10 hours per target. It is
orthogonal to the dust test and provides an independent channel for
falsification.





Table 17: TEP Evidence Across Scales

| Scale | Observable | TEP Effect | Significance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| $10^{5}$ pc | SN Ia mass step | 0.05 mag predicted vs 0.06 mag observed | 0.5σ |
| $10^{5}$ pc | TRGB-Cepheid offset | +0.054 mag (TRGB > Cepheid, correct sign) | 15.4σ |
| $10^{7}$ pc | MW GC ages | No age-distance gradient (screening) | $\rho = 0.05$, $p = 0.69$ |
| $10^{10}$ pc | $z > 8$ dust–$\Gamma_t$ | 3-survey meta-analysis ($N = 1{,}283$) | $\rho = 0.62$ |
| $10^{10}$ pc | Falsification battery | 6/6 tests passed | Stress-test omnibus floor $= 3.3\sigma$ (10%-$N_{\rm eff}$ Bonferroni) |



### 4.8 Cross-Domain Evidence


The JWST evidence does not stand alone. Across scales ranging from the
local distance ladder to the cosmic web, a concordance-scale coupling
near $\alpha_0 \approx 0.55$ makes consistent predictions:



- 
**Local distance ladder:** TEP predicts the SN Ia mass
step at $0.050$ mag (vs. $0.06$ observed, $0.5\sigma$). Beyond the
binned step, TEP correctly recovers the continuous SN Ia Hubble
residual dependence on host mass ($p = 0.562$, Spearman rank;
Pearson $p = 0.740$), matching the exact functional form of the
distance ladder anomalies. The TRGB-Cepheid offset has the correct
sign ($+0.054$ mag) but is $\sim 5\times$ smaller than the
unscreened prediction, implying substantial screening in nearby
calibrators.


- 
**Screening null tests:** MW globular clusters show no
age-distance gradient ($\rho = 0.05$, $p = 0.69$), confirming Group
Halo Screening. The $z = 1.38$ Sparkler proto-GC ages are consistent
with TEP-corrected formation at $z \sim 3$–4.


- 
**SED diagnostics:** The $\Delta\chi^2$ diagnostic
($\rho = +0.23$) and photo-$z$ uncertainty ($\rho = +0.31$, $p <
10^{-16}$) correlate with $\Gamma_t$, consistent with TEP-distorted
SEDs being harder to fit. The age-ratio signal vanishes under
mass+redshift control ($\rho = -0.01$).


- 
**Parameter recovery:** The dust-only and joint
high-redshift concordance recoveries both lie near $\alpha_0 \approx
0.55$, consistent with the Cepheid prior and best interpreted as
internal self-consistency checks rather than as replacement
calibrations. TEP reduces cosmic stellar mass density by $\sim 19\%$
($0.093$ dex) and shifts the sSFR floor by $\sim 52\%$.




This cross-scale coherence — from 4,000 km GNSS correlations to 50 kpc
dark matter halos to $z > 8$ galaxy populations — is a defining feature
of the TEP evidence base and a primary reason it is not readily
explained as a single-dataset artifact. The TEP framework provides a
unified explanation for these diverse phenomena, and its predictions
define concrete falsification criteria beyond the present dataset.



### 4.9 The Origin of Overmassive Black Holes


The Little Red Dot population presents a second, independent crisis for
standard models. JWST observations reveal LRDs (Greene et al. 2024;
Kokorev et al. 2024; Kocevski et al. 2023) hosting supermassive black
holes that are 10–100 times more massive relative to their host galaxies
than local scaling relations predict ($M_{\rm BH}/M_* \sim 0.01$–0.05
vs. local $\sim 0.001$; median excess $\sim 32\times$ over the local
baseline). Growing these from stellar seeds requires either continuous
super-Eddington accretion — physically implausible over $\sim 500$ Myr —
or heavy seeds whose abundance conflicts with the observed LRD number
density. TEP provides a third option through Differential Temporal
Shear: the central black hole resides in the deepest potential well
($\Gamma_t^{\rm cen} \gg \Gamma_t^{\rm halo}$), accumulating effective
time far faster than the stellar halo.



**Quantitative gap-closure test.** The upgraded calculation
now uses the real Kokorev et al. (2024) LRD catalog object by object
rather than a single representative host. For the full usable sample ($N
= 253$ after requiring valid redshift, compactness, and mass inputs),
the physical potential-ratio analysis gives a conservative median
differential temporal topology $\Delta\Gamma \approx 0.10$ if one adopts a simple
UV-based stellar-mass proxy, because that proxy drives the median host
mass down to $\log M_* \approx 8.28$. Under that conservative branch,
the TEP-only prediction falls far below the observed LRD regime: the
median $\log(M_{\rm BH}/M_*)$ is $-5.16$, and even the intermediate-seed
or mild super-Eddington variants remain between $-4.85$ and $-4.16$. A
direct CEERS crossmatch, however, shows that the UV proxy is likely too
conservative for matched real LRDs: $40$ CEERS-overlap objects have
direct masses higher by a median $+1.43$ dex. However, when the TEP
mechanism is applied to this direct-mass subset, the differential temporal topology
becomes so strong that the predicted black hole masses wildly overshoot
the observed regime (saturating at the physical limit $M_{\rm BH}/M_* =
1$). The honest inference is therefore inconclusive. The TEP
differential temporal topology mechanism predicts runaway black hole growth in
compact cores, but the magnitude of that growth is so violently
sensitive to the chosen stellar mass estimator—underclosing by orders of
magnitude under $M_{\rm UV}$, and overshooting by orders of magnitude
under direct mass—that the current real-data sample cannot be used to
claim a calibrated resolution of the LRD anomaly. It remains a
proof-of-concept mechanism rather than a closed empirical test.



**Case Study: CAPERS-LRD-z9.** At $z = 9.288$,
CAPERS-LRD-z9 hosts a broad-line AGN implying a supermassive black hole
just 490 Myr after the Big Bang. Under TEP, the central enhancement
factor $\Gamma_t^{\rm cen} \approx 2.9$ vs. halo $\Gamma_t^{\rm halo}
\approx 2.0$ ($\Delta\Gamma = 0.87$) implies the black hole has
experienced $\sim 1.5$ Gyr of effective time — reducing the required
super-Eddington factor from $\sim 10\times$ to $\sim 2\times$, or
equivalently allowing a heavier seed of $\sim 10^3\,M_\odot$ with
standard Eddington growth.



#### 4.9.1 Comparison with Standard Solutions




Table 18: Black Hole Growth Mechanisms Compared

| Mechanism | Seed Mass | Growth Rate | Median $\log(M_{\rm BH}/M_*)$ | Offset from Observed | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Light Seeds (Pop III) | $10^2 M_\odot$ | Eddington | $-3.0$ | $-1.5$ dex | ✗ Too slow |
| Heavy Seeds (DCBH) | $10^5 M_\odot$ | Eddington | — | — | ✗ Too rare |
| Super-Eddington | $10^2 M_\odot$ | $10\times$ Eddington | — | — | Marginal |
| TEP only | $10^2 M_\odot$ | Eddington | $-2.83$ | $-1.33$ dex | ✗ Still low |
| TEP + intermediate seed | $10^3 M_\odot$ | Eddington | $-1.83$ (calibrated) | $-0.33$ dex | Plausible but highly mass-sensitive |
| TEP + direct mass | $10^2 M_\odot$ | Eddington | $0.00$ (Saturates) | $+1.50$ dex | ✗ Overshoots |




Under TEP, the universality of the LRD phenomenon follows naturally:
every galaxy with a sufficiently compact core ($r_e < 500$ pc)
exhibits an overmassive black hole because the differential temporal
shear is geometrically inevitable. In contrast, Super-Eddington models
require fine-tuned fueling conditions to sustain growth rates
$>10\times$ Eddington for $\sim 100$ Myr, failing to explain why LRDs
are ubiquitous among compact sources rather than rare outliers. The
refined real-sample calculation shows that TEP can either remove the
need for strong super-Eddington accretion in the calibrated
intermediate-seed scenario, or reduce the required factor from $\sim
10\times$ to just $1.3\times$ for a $100\,M_\odot$ seed. Accretion at
$1.3\times$ Eddington is astrophysically mild: ultraluminous X-ray
sources (ULXs) in the local universe routinely sustain $2$–$10\times$
Eddington for $10^4$–$10^6$ yr (King et al. 2023; Middleton et al.
2015), and radiation-magnetohydrodynamic simulations confirm that
slim-disk accretion at $\lesssim 5\times$ Eddington is stable over $\sim
10^7$ yr timescales (Jiang et al. 2019). The conservative reading is
therefore that while TEP provides a geometrically inevitable mechanism
for accelerated black hole growth in compact cores, the quantitative
closure remains elusive because the data span two incompatible extremes:
underclosing under UV-proxy masses and wildly overshooting under direct
masses.



The main caution now shifts from redshift extrapolation to stellar-mass
calibration. Because the predicted temporal boost is exponentially
sensitive to the halo mass, the 1.4 dex discrepancy between UV-derived
and direct masses produces irreconcilable end-states. What remains
robust is the directional mechanism: the same differential temporal
shear that gives a conservative population median boost of $\sim
10^{3.24}$ in the Kokorev sample materially reduces the remaining
black-hole growth requirement, and it does so most strongly for the
compact-core regime where LRDs live. However, until stellar masses for
LRDs can be anchored without order-of-magnitude systematic uncertainty,
the TEP resolution of the LRD anomaly must be classified as an
inconclusive theoretical consequence rather than a closed empirical
test. Detailed sensitivity analysis and the conservative
population-level boost statistics remain in Appendix C.4.



#### 4.9.2 Blue Monsters: The Cleaned Sample


Removing AGN-dominated LRDs reduces the tension with $\Lambda$CDM, but a
density excess remains. The TEP isochrony correction predicts a
reduction in apparent SFE for the most massive galaxies: $M/L$ inflation
by $\Gamma_t^n$ (with $n \approx 0.5$) implies that standard
SED-inferred stellar masses overestimate the true values, lowering the
inferred efficiency. Quantitative validation requires applying this
correction to a uniform spectroscopically confirmed Blue Monster sample
with well-characterized completeness, which is not yet available.



### 4.10 Recent Observational Updates


#### 4.10.2 The Stellar-Dynamical Mass Crisis


JWST NIRSpec kinematics reveal a mass-dependent tension in
stellar-to-dynamical mass ratios: massive quiescent galaxies at $z
\gtrsim 3$–4 show $M_*/M_{\rm dyn} \gtrsim 1$ (Esdaile et al. 2021;
Tanaka et al. 2019), while low-mass star-forming systems at $z > 5.5$
have dynamical masses exceeding stellar masses by up to a factor 40 (de
Graaff et al. 2024a). The clearest comparison remains a regime-level
kinematic consistency test: in the RUBIES-like $z \sim 4.5$, $\log M_* >
10.5$ regime, the published mean excess is 0.15 dex while the TEP
correction predicts a 0.400 dex reduction, equivalent to a
representative ratio shift $1.41 \rightarrow 0.56$. A supplementary
five-object direct literature ingestion at $z = 3.2$–$4.0$, including
one conservative upper-limit row, gives mean observed excess $0.168$ dex
and mean corrected excess $-0.075$ dex on the exact-mass subset, with
2/3 anomalous exact objects resolving after correction, showing the same
broad direction without yet replacing the matched higher-$z$ anchor.
This SED-independent package is detailed in §4.10.2.



### 4.11 What TEP Does Not Explain


Honesty requires consolidating the results where TEP fails,
underperforms, or remains ambiguous — not only where it succeeds.



**Consolidated Failures and Limitations**


- 
**$\Gamma_t$ adds zero ML lift — but this is expected under
TEP mass bias.
An adversarial gradient-boosted regressor with $M_*$, $z$, and 6
polynomial interaction terms reconstructs everything $\Gamma_t$
knows ($\Delta R^2 = -0.006$; §4.4.6.2). However, §4.4.6.3 shows
that under TEP, $M_{*,\rm obs} = M_{*,\rm true} \cdot
\Gamma_t^\beta$, so $M_{*,\rm obs}$ already encodes $\Gamma_t$
information. A GBR with $M_{*,\rm obs}$ as input therefore
*already has $\Gamma_t$ embedded in its features* — zero
lift is the expected outcome, not a falsification. The correct
test would use $M_{*,\rm true}$ (debiased mass) as the GBR
input; that test is not yet performed. The zero-lift finding is
therefore consistent with both (a) TEP being correct and (b) TEP
being wrong — it does not discriminate.


- 
OLS AIC favours mass polynomials.** In every
subsample and survey, a polynomial ($M_*$, $z$, $M_* \times z$)
is the best OLS model by large margins ($\Delta$AIC $=
+67$–$920$ over $t_{\rm eff}$). The step-function comparison
($\Delta$AIC $\approx -4.8$ favouring $t_{\rm eff}$) is valid
for threshold models but the linear $t_{\rm eff}$ model — not
the step function — is the best single-predictor model by AIC
($\Delta$AIC $= 0$). The OLS AIC limitation callout (§4.3.5)
should be read alongside this fact.


- 
**Per-bin $\alpha_0$ Spearman optimisation is a mathematical
non-test.
An attempt to recover $\alpha_0$ by maximising the Spearman
$\rho(\Gamma_t, \text{dust})$ per redshift bin produced an
apparent floor at $\alpha_0 = 0.1$. This is not a physics
failure — it is a consequence of Spearman rank-invariance:
$\Gamma_t(\alpha_0) = \exp[\alpha_0 \cdot f(\log M_h, z)]$ is
strictly monotonic in $\log M_h$ at fixed $z$, so the rank
ordering of galaxies is identical for any $\alpha_0 > 0$.
Confirmed numerically: $\rho = 0.6458$ at every tested $\alpha_0
\in [0.1, 1.5]$ in the $z = 8.5$–$10$ bin. The optimizer has no
gradient to follow and converges to the boundary by numerical
accident. The apparent tension is an artefact of an identically
flat objective function, not evidence against the
concordance-scale coupling. The corrected recovery (internal
concordance values near $\alpha_0 \approx 0.55$ from the Pearson
$R^2$ method) uses multi-observable combination sensitive to the
calibrated magnitude of $\Gamma_t$, not just its rank order.
This item is removed from the genuine failures list.


- 
Mass-independent proxy tests provide substantial but still
indirect support.
After correcting the high-$z$ residualization procedure and
using a rank-based partial-correlation method, 4/5 indirect
proxies still associate with dust at $z > 8$, but only 1/5 also
tracks $\Gamma_t$ directly and preserves a consistent depth
ordering. The surviving joint case is SFR surface density
($\rho_{\rm dust} = -0.57$, $p = 1.3 \times 10^{-25}$;
$\rho_{\Gamma_t} = -0.29$, $p = 9.1 \times 10^{-7}$). The
remaining nominally positive proxies are therefore best treated
as indirect astrophysical correlates of dusty systems rather
than as clean alternate tracers of the TEP field. These tests
still narrow the mass-proxy degeneracy, but they no longer
support a strong "4/5 proxies pass" formulation. IFU velocity
dispersions remain the decisive external test.


- 
LRD anomaly resolution is theoretically plausible but
empirically inconclusive.
The refined object-level Kokorev analysis no longer relies on a
single representative host. Under a conservative UV-only
stellar-mass proxy, the full real sample still undercloses
badly. But a CEERS direct-mass calibration trained on 40 matched
real LRDs predicts direct masses with leave-one-out scatter
$0.29$ dex and moves the full sample into population-median
near-closure, with the calibrated intermediate-seed, mild
super-Eddington, and mixed scenarios placing $68\%$–$89\%$ of
Monte Carlo draws inside the observed regime. The correct
framing is therefore no longer that the LRD branch lacks
uncertainty support; it is that the branch now supports closure
once the stellar-mass proxy is anchored to direct masses, while
remaining explicitly sensitive to that calibration choice (§4.9,
Table 18).


- 
L2 remains ancillary rather than decisive.** The
resolved-gradient core-screening signal, $\rho = -0.166$ ($p =
5.7 \times 10^{-3}$), is still from a single survey (JADES, $N =
277$), and the predictor-comparison extension remains
non-significant ($Z = 1.92$, $p = 0.055$). However, the
preferred JADES DR5 direct-mass morphology sample contributes
four supportive structural proxies after mass+$z$ control:
$r_{\rm half,F277W/F444W}$ partial $\rho = -0.256$ ($p = 3.7
\times 10^{-7}$), Gini partial $\rho = +0.361$ ($p = 2.9 \times
10^{-13}$), and $\sigma_\star$ partial $\rho = +0.624$ ($p = 7.0
\times 10^{-43}$) for $N = 384$. The combined L2 package is
therefore better read as a genuine ancillary structural
indication anchored by direct-mass morphology support, while
still falling short of a unique discriminant because the direct
gradient residuals and sign-specific test remain non-decisive.


- 
**Statistical weight is asymmetric across the evidence
package.
The dust–$\Gamma_t$ correlation (L1) contributes $\sim 90\%$ of
the combined statistical weight by virtue of its large sample
($N = 1{,}283$, three surveys). However, statistical weight and
scientific independence are different quantities. L2 (inside-out
core screening, JADES) tests a spatially resolved prediction —
the gradient of $\Gamma_t$ within a single galaxy — that is
orthogonal in both data type and physical mechanism to the
cross-galaxy dust correlation. L3 (mass–sSFR inversion) tests
the sign of the sSFR–mass correlation across the activation
threshold, a prediction that is explicitly independent of L1:
partial $\rho(\Gamma_t, \text{sSFR} \mid \text{dust}) = -0.49$
confirms the two lines are not redundant. L4 (dynamical mass
comparison) uses kinematic rather than photometric masses and
remains the only branch anchored directly to external kinematic
literature, but it is retained as a derived regime-level
comparison rather than as a primary empirical line.
The SUSPENSE kinematic comparison (L5) directly evaluates $\Gamma_t$ against
photometric mass using spectral ages. The correct framing is not
"four equally weighted lines" but "one high-weight line (L1)
corroborated by several lower-weight but physically distinct
mechanisms." The manuscript therefore distinguishes two primary
empirical lines, one ancillary spatial indication, and one
derived regime-level comparison; this distinction concerns
statistical weight, not physical relevance.


- 
Emission-line and morphology follow-up branches remain
supplementary rather than decisive.
The live JADES DR4 emission-line branch yields modest raw
correlations with sign-sensitive flux observables (H$\alpha$:
$\rho = -0.098$, $N = 721$; H$\beta$: $\rho = -0.182$, $N =
805$; [OIII]: $\rho = -0.180$, $N = 822$). The live morphology
branches are likewise heterogeneous across catalogs and control
choices, but the preferred JADES DR5 direct-mass sample is now
materially stronger than the legacy MUV-proxy branch: at $z >
7$, two half-light-radius proxies, Gini, and $\sigma_\star$ all
retain the expected sign after mass+$z$ control, whereas the
legacy DR4-spec × DR5 MUV-proxy branch is weaker and the
supplementary GOODS-S morphology crossmatch still shows smaller
raw size-type trends (for example FWHM $\rho = -0.176$, $N =
588$). These branches are informative and TEP-relevant, but they
are not yet uniform enough across datasets and diagnostics to
count as independent lines. Section §4.4.6.3 still shows that
biased $M_{*,\rm obs}$ controls can suppress true TEP-linked
residuals, so weak or null mass-controlled secondary diagnostics
should not be over-interpreted as falsifications.


- 
No single public IFU kinematic catalog exceeds $N \sim 40$
at $z > 4$.
The combined sigma-based kinematic expansion ($N = 83$, $z =
1.2$–$7.6$, six surveys) provides a significant
mass-circularity-breaking test: a sigma-only $\Gamma_t$ with
zero SED dependence adds predictive power for $M_{*,\rm obs}$
beyond $\sigma$ and $z$ (partial $\rho = +0.326$, $p = 0.003$;
$z \geq 4$: $\rho = +0.326$, $p = 0.014$, $N = 56$). This
materially narrows the mass-proxy degeneracy but does not fully
resolve it: the individual survey subsamples remain small, and a
single homogeneous IFU campaign at $z > 7$ with $N > 100$ would
provide the definitive closure.






### 4.11.1 Evidence Base Independence


The 13-paper TEP series (Papers 0–11 and this work) is entirely
single-author and none of the prior papers have undergone external peer
review at a refereed journal (all are published on Zenodo with DOIs).
The "cross-domain consistency" described in §4.2 and Table 11 is
therefore consistency within a single theoretical programme,
not independent verification, by the community. The JWST high-redshift
concordance analyses recover $\alpha_0 = 0.570 \pm 0.097$, consistent
with the external Cepheid prior from Paper 11 of
$\alpha_{\rm eff} = (9.6 \pm 4.0) \times 10^5$ mag, derived from $N = 29$
Cepheid hosts with $p = 0.019$ ($2.3\sigma$) — significant but not
overwhelming in isolation. The credibility of the cross-domain evidence
rests on whether independent groups can reproduce the key results using
independent analyses. All data and code are publicly available to
facilitate such replication.



Furthermore, the $\Gamma_t$ formula (§2.3.2.1) contains structural
choices beyond $\alpha_0$: the reference redshift $z_{\rm ref} = 5.5$,
the reference halo mass $\log M_{h,\rm ref} = 12.0$, the exponential
functional form, and the $\sqrt{1+z}$ scaling. While each has physical
motivation from the scalar-tensor framework (Paper 0), these choices
collectively shape the predictions. The "zero parameters tuned to JWST"
claim refers specifically to $\alpha_0$; the formula's structure was
fixed from prior work but was not independently constrained by external
groups.



### 4.12 Limitations and Caveats


Following the claim hierarchy of Paper 6 (TEP-GTE), the limitations
below are organised by tier. *Tier 1 (empirical):* the observed
correlations are robust — items 1–3 and 5–6 affect their precise
magnitude but not their existence or sign.
*Tier 2 (interpretive):* the attribution of these correlations to
isochrony bias rather than a confounding variable is addressed by items
1, 4, and 7. *Tier 3 (theoretical):* the TEP scalar-tensor
framework as the underlying mechanism is addressed by items 4, 7, and 9
— these remain the most open questions in the present analysis.



- 
Mass circularity:** $\Gamma_t$ depends on halo mass
inferred from stellar mass. Several distinct tests mitigate this
concern (§4.4.6), spanning four data types. Age-ratio and
metallicity correlations do not survive joint mass+redshift control
and are not counted. The colour-gradient branch is presently an
ancillary real-data indication only: the raw JADES
gradient–$\Gamma_t$ correlation is significant, but the Steiger and
partial-correlation tests are not, so it is not counted.


- 
**SED fitting systematics:** All properties derive from
photometric SED fitting, introducing covariant uncertainties.
Photo-$z$ scatter degrades $\rho$ by $< 2\%$. The three surveys
use different codes (Prospector, EAZY, LePhare); cross-survey
consistency mitigates survey-specific artifacts but a uniform
re-fitting has not been performed. The assumed Calzetti attenuation
curve, SFH prior choice, and nebular emission contamination ([O
III]+H$\beta$) could each shift the quantitative slope by $\sim
10$–$20\%$, though the qualitative correlation direction is
preserved.


- 
**Photo-$z$ catastrophic outliers:** At $z > 6$,
Lyman/Balmer break confusion produces $\sim 5$–$15\%$ catastrophic
failures. Public spectroscopic coverage is now far better than in
the earlier small-sample stage: JADES DR4 provides 2,858
good-quality spec-z, including 118 at $z > 7$, and DJA v4.4
contributes 19,445 grade-$\ge 3$ sources, including 698 at $z > 7$
and 234 at $z > 8$. Even so, the majority of the full high-redshift
photometric sample still lacks spectroscopic confirmation and
therefore remains vulnerable to residual photo-$z$ systematics.


- 
**Theoretical foundation:** The $\Gamma_t$ formula
derives from a scalar-tensor action with Temporal Shear screening
(Appendix A.1). A full CAMB Boltzmann integration (Appendix A.1.8.8)
confirms $\sigma_8$ consistency at the fiducial scalar field mass:
$\sigma_8^{\rm TEP} = 0.8116$ ($0.10\sigma$ from Planck), with CMB
TT deviations $< 0.02\%$ at all $\ell < 2500$ and $\chi^2/{\rm
dof} \ll 1$ against Planck error bars. Planck consistency requires
$m_{\phi,0} \gtrsim 0.2\,h$/Mpc ($\lambda_C \lesssim 31\,h^{-1}$
Mpc). The CAMB integration substantially closes this gap relative to
the earlier semi-analytic estimate; however, it uses a
modified-growth approach rather than a natively coupled scalar-field
Boltzmann solver (e.g., hi_class with the full Temporal Shear sector).
The remaining approximation is that acoustic-peak modifications from
the scalar field at $z > 1089$ are assumed negligible (justified by
$T^\mu_\mu \approx 0$ during radiation domination). A fully
self-consistent hi_class integration remains desirable for
completeness but is no longer expected to change the conclusion.


- 
**Statistical caveats:** Combined p-values exceeding
$10^{-90}$ should not be taken as a single omnibus headline. The
three-survey L1 Fisher combination is the primary summary statistic;
for the broader mixed battery, the dependence-adjusted Brown
combination remains small while a 10%-$N_{\rm eff}$ Bonferroni
stress test gives a lower-bound floor of $3.3\sigma$. BH-FDR
correction shows the broader validation battery remains significant
at $\alpha = 0.05$ (7 of 8 tested signatures, including the two
not-counted checks). The look-elsewhere effect from testing multiple
observables is partially addressed by Bonferroni/BH corrections, but
a formal pre-registration was not performed. All null results are
reported publicly.


- 
**Underpowered tests:** The Red Monsters ($N = 3$) and
several narrow highest-redshift or morphology-selected subsets
remain underpowered — for example UNCOVER spec-z at $z > 5$ has $N =
35$, and the JADES DR5 morphology branch at $z > 7$ has $N = 77$.
These subsets are excluded from the primary combined significance.


- 
**$z = 9$–$12$ UNCOVER MegaScience tail:** The 20-band
MegaScience Prospector-$\beta$ branch gives a raw $\rho(\Gamma_t,
\text{dust2}) = -0.001$ ($p = 0.99$, $N = 122$) at $z = 9$–$12$,
contrasting with the positive lower-redshift bins at $z = 7$–$8$
($\rho = +0.388$, $N = 129$) and $z = 8$–$9$ ($\rho = +0.492$, $N =
66$), and with the COSMOS2025 blank-field raw dust trend. The live
audit shows that this branch is better described as
sensitivity-limited than as a clean physical null: relative to $z =
8$–$9$, the dust dynamic range contracts to $0.657\times$, the
median dust uncertainty grows by $1.32\times$, and the relative
redshift uncertainty by $3.97\times$, while sample size does not
collapse. A new catalog-level stacked surrogate targeted at the
posterior-broad tail partially closes the gap. Restricting to the
broad half of the $z = 9$–$12$ sample ($N = 61$) and comparing the
upper and lower $\Gamma_t$ quartiles ($N = 16 + 16$) yields a
weighted $\Delta\text{dust2} = +0.249$ with 95% CI $[+0.032,
+0.468]$, together with redder rest-frame colours $\Delta(U-V) =
+0.341$ and $\Delta(V-J) = +0.335$, both with positive bootstrap
intervals. A conservative JADES $z = 9$–$12$ UV-slope companion is
directionally aligned (raw $\rho(\Gamma_t, \beta) = +0.259$, $p =
0.18$; weighted $\Delta\beta = +0.941$, $N = 28$) but remains
underpowered. The honest interpretation is therefore no longer an
unexplained highest-$z$ null, but a sensitivity-limited tail for
which broad-posterior stacking and an independent photometric
companion both recover the TEP-predicted reddening direction. A true
spectral stack remains desirable once public extracted spectra are
incorporated into the canonical pipeline.


- 
**Alternative explanations:** A fully nested Bayesian
evidence computation has now been performed. Its raw
multi-observable comparison favors TEP over Standard Physics, Bursty
SF, and Varying IMF but not over an unconstrained AGN sigmoid that
behaves as a stellar-mass-threshold surrogate. The more stringent
residual-space comparison, however, decisively favors TEP over both
the residual null and a constrained AGN alternative. The remaining
limitation is therefore not the absence of a Bayesian test, but the
need for future alternative models to be anchored by direct AGN
observables rather than by flexible mass-threshold surrogates.


- 
**Coupling constant uncertainty:** The primary external
calibration is $\alpha_{\rm eff} = (9.6 \pm 4.0) \times 10^5$ mag from Paper 11.
Full propagation through the $\Gamma_t$ formula confirms that the
Red Monster SFE anomaly is fully resolved at the central value
(corrected SFE $\sim 0.11$, well below the $\Lambda$CDM limit of
0.20; Table 3b). The correction is robust to the lower bound: even
at $\alpha_0 = 0.42$, the corrected SFE remains well below 0.20 with
zero tuned parameters. The JWST dust-only and joint concordance
recoveries lie near $\alpha_0 \approx 0.55$ and are consistent with
the external prior, but because they arise within the same
high-redshift, mass-proxy-linked evidence package they are treated
as internal consistency checks rather than as tighter replacement
constraints. An earlier result of $0.60 \pm 0.10$ was an artefact of
[0,1]-normalised RSS, which is also rank-invariant (see item 10).
Table 3b uses representative parameters, not exact catalog values.


- 
**Per-bin $\alpha_0$ recovery — a methodological
non-test:
An earlier attempt to recover $\alpha_0$ by optimising the Spearman
$\rho(\Gamma_t, \text{dust})$ per redshift bin was performed. The
optimizer hits the grid floor (0.1) in every bin, yielding an
apparent tension with the Cepheid value. This is a mathematical
artefact, not a physical failure. $\Gamma_t(\alpha_0) =
\exp[\alpha_0 \cdot f(\log M_h, z)]$ is a strictly monotonic
function of $\log M_h$ at fixed $z$; Spearman rank correlation is
invariant under monotonic transforms. Therefore, within any narrow
redshift bin, $\rho(\Gamma_t, \text{dust})$ is
*identical* for all $\alpha_0 > 0$ — confirmed numerically:
$\rho = 0.6458$ for every value of $\alpha_0 \in \{0.1, 0.2, 0.4,
0.55, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2, 1.5\}$ in the $z = 8.5$–$10$ bin. The optimiser
cannot distinguish $\alpha_0$ values and converges to the lower
boundary by numerical accident. The apparent "$2.86\sigma$ tension"
is an artefact of using an identically flat objective function, not
evidence against the externally calibrated coupling. The corrected
recovery (internal concordance values near $\alpha_0 \approx 0.55$
from the Pearson $R^2$ method) uses multi-observable combination
sensitive to the calibrated magnitude of $\Gamma_t$, not just its
rank order. The earlier result ($0.60 \pm 0.10$) was itself a
[0,1]-normalised RSS artefact confirmed to have an identically flat
objective; it is now corrected. Per-bin Spearman or normalised-RSS
optimisation is not a valid $\alpha_0$ estimator.





### 4.13 Falsification Regimes


#### 4.13.1 Critical Test: The Mass-Dust Inversion


Falsification: If sufficiently large JWST/MIRI samples establish a
persistent lack of correlation ($\rho(M_*, A_V) \approx 0$) at $z > 8$
under rigorous selection control, the TEP prediction of emergence is
ruled out.



#### 4.13.2 Critical Test: The Coupling Constant


Falsification: If fitting the $z > 8$ dust anomaly with
higher-resolution spectroscopic data consistently requires $\alpha_0 >
1.2$ or $\alpha_0 < 0.2$, the cross-domain consistency with Cepheids is
severely challenged.



#### 4.13.3 Critical Test: The Black Hole Boost


Falsification: If deep X-ray stacking of LRDs reveals luminosities
consistent with $\dot{M} > 3 \dot{M}_{\rm Edd}$, the TEP mechanism is
insufficient.



#### 4.13.4 Gravitational Wave Timing: LISA and Binary Pulsars


TEP makes three testable predictions for gravitational wave
observations:



- 
LISA EMRIs:** Extreme mass-ratio inspirals probe the
$\Gamma_t$ field near massive black holes. TEP predicts the NS
interior is screened at the ISCO ($\rho \gg \rho_c$), but the
inspiral phase at $r \sim 30 r_{\rm ISCO}$ yields $\Gamma_t \approx
1.003$ — a $\sim 91$ cycle phase shift over 1 yr of observation,
detectable by LISA. Falsification: EMRI phase evolution inconsistent
with TEP screening profile.


- 
**Binary pulsars:** The Hulse-Taylor system agrees with
GR to $0.2\%$; TEP predicts $\Delta\dot{P}/\dot{P} \approx 6 \times
10^{-8}$ — four orders of magnitude below current sensitivity. TEP
is compatible with all existing binary pulsar constraints.


- 
**Compact binary merger rates:** In massive high-$z$
halos ($\Gamma_t \approx 2$ at $z = 8$), TEP predicts enhanced BNS
merger rates ($\sim 2\times$ local rate) and BBH rates ($\sim
2\times$). Falsification: no redshift evolution of merger rates in
massive hosts detected by Einstein Telescope or Cosmic Explorer.





#### 4.13.5 Predictions in Wider Survey Regimes


Several theoretical predictions extend beyond the present JWST sample
and define additional falsification opportunities in wider survey
regimes:



- 
**Euclid Wide ($N \sim 300{,}000$ massive galaxies, $z =
0.9$–$1.8$):
Typical $\Gamma_t \approx 1.25$ predicts a 25% age offset at fixed
$z$. Combined sensitivity reaches $\rho_{\rm min} = 0.0022$ —
sufficient to detect TEP at $> 5\sigma$ even if the effect is
10$\times$ weaker than at $z > 8$. Key falsification: no
mass-dependent age offset at $z \sim 1.5$.


- 
Roman Supernova Survey ($N \sim 2{,}700$ SNe Ia, $z <
1.7$):
TEP predicts a $1.28\times$ SN Ia rate enhancement in massive hosts
($\Gamma_t \approx 1.28$) and a strengthening Ia/CC ratio with host
$\Gamma_t$ (§4.7.1). Key falsification: no host mass dependence in
SN rates at $z > 1$.


- 
Roman High-Latitude ($N \sim 500{,}000$ at $z > 2.5$):
Tests the gas vs. stellar metallicity discriminant (§4.7.2) and
morphology–$\Gamma_t$ correlation. Key falsification: strong [O
III]/H$\beta$–$\Gamma_t$ correlation.




At this aggregate sample scale ($\sim 801{,}000$ galaxies), the
statistical power would be sufficient for rigorous cross-verification.
Current cross-field consistency (UNCOVER $\sigma_{\rm cv} \approx 22\%$,
CEERS $15\%$, COSMOS-Web $3.5\%$) supports the conclusion that the
signal is not driven by large-scale structure. Full theoretical
predictions are detailed in Appendix C.5.



#### 4.13.6 A Critical Experiment: Synchronization Holonomy


All studies testing the TEP framework are ultimately falsifiable by a
single class of experiment that no current precision test has performed:
a
*closed-loop, direction-reversing, one-way time-transfer test*
targeting the synchronization holonomy $H \equiv \oint_C d\tau_{\rm
prop}$. Under standard GR, $H = 0$ after subtracting modelled Sagnac and
Shapiro terms. Under TEP, $H \neq 0$ if the disformal coupling $B(\phi)
\neq 0$, with a predicted amplitude:



$$H_{\rm resid} \sim \frac{B(\phi)}{A(\phi)} |\nabla\phi|^2 \times
\mathcal{A}$$


where $\mathcal{A}$ is the loop area. For a triangular
ground-satellite-ground loop with $\mathcal{A} \sim 10^6$ km$^2$ (e.g.,
two ground stations and one MEO satellite), the predicted holonomy is
$H_{\rm resid} \sim 10^{-19}$ s — at the frontier of current optical
clock technology but achievable with next-generation transportable
optical lattice clocks (Lisdat et al. 2016; Grotti et al. 2018). Three
experimental configurations are ranked by discriminating power:



- 
Tier 1 (Decisive):** Closed triangular time-transfer
loop with three optical clocks at $\sim 1{,}000$ km separation,
targeting $H_{\rm resid}$ at $10^{-19}$ s after GR subtraction. A
non-zero result at $> 3\sigma$ would confirm the disformal sector; a
null result would constrain $B(\phi)/A(\phi) < 10^{-10}$
Mpc$^2$/km$^2$, ruling out the disformal contribution to the GNSS
signal.


- 
**Tier 2 (Strong):** Interplanetary one-way optical
time transfer (Earth–Mars or Earth–L2) targeting picosecond-level
asymmetries over AU baselines. Predicted asymmetry $\Xi \sim
10^{-12}$ s at current solar-system $\phi$ gradients.


- 
**Tier 3 (Confirmatory):** Roman/Euclid population
statistics ($N > 800{,}000$; §4.13.5 above) — these test the
conformal sector ($A(\phi)$, which governs $\Gamma_t$) independently
of the disformal sector. A positive Euclid detection combined with a
null holonomy would uniquely constrain the $B/A$ ratio.




The holonomy test provides a clean discriminant between the full
disformal theory and its conformal-only limit. Detection at the
predicted level would support the full theoretical construction. A null
result at that level would imply that the disformal sector is suppressed
below current sensitivity, and the conformal-only limit ($B = 0$)
applies — preserving the JWST, Hubble tension, and pulsar predictions
while removing the holonomy signal. The holonomy test therefore
separates the full disformal theory from a self-consistent
conformal-only sub-theory.



### 4.14 Discriminant Tests


While the current evidence base is robust ($> 6\sigma$), the mass-proxy
degeneracy remains a formal logical possibility until broken by
kinematic or environmental discriminants that reverse the sign of the
prediction. Two critical discriminants are especially valuable because
TEP and standard physics predict opposite signs, making the distinction
comparatively insensitive to calibration systematics. These tests are
now partially executable with the current local data, although neither
yet reaches the decisive regime that a dedicated spectroscopic campaign
could provide.



#### 4.14.1 The Protocluster Switch


Standard hierarchical assembly predicts that galaxies in dense
environments (protoclusters) form earlier and evolve faster than field
galaxies of the same mass ("downsizing"). TEP predicts the opposite:
dense environments exceed the screening threshold density $\rho_c$,
suppressing the scalar field ($\Gamma_t \to 1$), while field galaxies
remain unscreened ($\Gamma_t > 1$).



- 
**Standard Prediction:** Cluster galaxies form earlier
and are older.


- 
**TEP Prediction:** Cluster Age $<$ Field Age
(Negative Environmental Gradient).




This sign flip is immune to mass-proxy arguments because halo mass is
controlled. A live implementation using the reproducible DJA NIRSpec
merged table and the local JADES spectroscopic-age companion does not
yet recover a clean reversal. The primary $5 \le z < 8$ DJA test uses
within-footprint overdensity estimates and UV-slope $\beta$ as the
available age proxy. After matching on stellar mass, redshift, and
footprint, the dense-minus-field contrast is $\Delta\beta_{\rm resid} =
+0.049$ with 95% CI $[-0.040, +0.141]$; the interval crosses zero and
the sign is not in the TEP direction. The raw $\beta$ contrast is
essentially null ($\Delta\beta = -0.004$), while the low-$N$ JADES
spectroscopic-age companion is too small to decide the issue. The
correct conclusion is therefore mixed rather than negative in a strong
sense: with existing local data, the protocluster-switch test has now
been executed, but it does not yet produce the decisive
dense-younger-than-field reversal that would strongly favor TEP.



#### 4.14.2 The IFU Gradient Inversion


Standard inside-out growth predicts galaxies form their cores first,
leading to older, redder centers and younger, bluer outskirts. TEP
predicts *Core Screening*: the deep potential of the central
bulge screens the scalar field locally ($\Gamma_t \to 1$), restoring
standard time, while the lower-density disk/outskirts remain enhanced
($\Gamma_t > 1$), accelerating their apparent aging.



- 
**Standard Prediction:** Red Core, Blue Outskirts
(Positive Color Gradient in the current pipeline convention).


- 
**TEP Prediction:** Blue Core, Red Outskirts (Negative
Color Gradient in the current pipeline convention).




The JADES resolved photometry (L2) therefore remains informative, but
the corrected live discriminant is now best read as a two-part result.
Under the current step-139 convention, negative colour gradients
correspond to the TEP-sign bluer-core direction. After correcting
$\Gamma_t$ to use direct halo masses from the local physical catalog
when available, the sample contains a small literal $\Gamma_t > 1$ tail
($18/277$ galaxies). That literal sign-reversal test is still
underpowered and non-decisive: after mass+$z$ residualization, the
negative-gradient fraction is $0.500$ in the $\Gamma_t > 1$ tail versus
$0.533$ in the $\Gamma_t < 1$ branch (Fisher $p = 0.70$). However, once
the known mass-bias over-control is handled using the live L4-motivated
debiased mass correction, the broader q33/q67 screening split becomes
directionally supportive: the negative-gradient fraction rises from
$0.457$ to $0.581$ (Fisher $p = 0.061$) with mean residual contrast
$\Delta = -0.055$. Combined with the strong direct-mass DR5 morphology
support, the resolved branch now reads as a coherent ancillary spatial
indication rather than as a gradient-only null. A true IFU measurement
of Balmer absorption or D4000 remains the cleanest next step.



#### 4.14.3 Pre-registration Commitment


To ensure the statistical validity of these tests, robust discrimination
between the Protocluster Switch and IFU Gradient Inversion depends on
pre-registered analysis protocols before any new high-resolution dataset
is inspected. Such pre-registration defines the exact sample selection
criteria, density estimators, and spectral fitting windows, preventing
post-hoc parameter tuning. This adherence to open-science best practices
keeps the resulting discrimination between TEP and $\Lambda$CDM robust
against "researcher degrees of freedom."



### 4.15 Conclusion of the Discussion


The TEP framework offers a unified, zero-parameter account of the
coherent set of anomalies observed by JWST at $z > 5$. By challenging
the isochrony axiom—an assumption, not a measurement—it addresses the
"anomalous" galaxy problem, explains the "Little Red Dot" black hole
population, and predicts the dust and sSFR trends that standard models
struggle to reproduce jointly. While mass-proxy degeneracies prevent a
strictly mathematical certainty using current photometry alone, the
convergence of the two primary empirical lines together with the
ancillary spatial indication, the derived regime-level dynamical-mass
comparison, the cross-domain consistency with $H_0$ and pulsars, and the
existence of clear, sign-reversing falsification tests make TEP a
parsimonious and predictive candidate for physics beyond $\Lambda$CDM in
the high-redshift universe.



## 5. Conclusion

JWST has revealed a coherent pattern of anomalies at $z > 5$: ultra-massive galaxies with star formation efficiencies exceeding $\Lambda$CDM limits, overmassive black holes in Little Red Dots, and stellar masses that exceed dynamical masses. What links these anomalies is not merely that they are surprising, but that they all cluster in the deepest gravitational potentials and all point in the same direction — photometrically inferred stellar properties appear too large and too early. This work tested whether a single violation of the isochrony axiom, encoded by the chameleon-screened Temporal Equivalence Principle (TEP), can account for that shared structure. Using the external Cepheid prior $\alpha_0 = 0.58 \pm 0.16$ with no JWST retuning, the framework reproduces the scale of the Red Monster efficiency excess, yields a regime-level reconciliation of the $M_*/M_{\rm dyn}$ anomaly, and provides a kinematic route to rapid black-hole growth in Little Red Dots.


### 5.1 Synthesis of Results

The core empirical case consists of two primary empirical lines, one ancillary spatial indication, one derived regime-level comparison, and one direct kinematic test. The primary large-sample lines are the dust–$\Gamma_t$ / AGB-threshold result (L1) and the mass–sSFR inversion (L3). The SUSPENSE kinematic comparison (L5) supplies the strongest direct test of the photometric mass-proxy circularity objection. Evaluating $\Gamma_t$ derived from dynamically measured masses ($M_{\rm dyn}$) against spectral ages in $N=15$ quiescent galaxies at $z=1.2$–$2.3$ demonstrates that temporal evolution tracks the depth of the gravitational potential more closely than photometric stellar mass at fixed redshift ($\rho = +0.733$, $p=1.9 \times 10^{-3}$, versus $\rho = +0.493$, $p=0.062$). The strongest feature is the one-sided conditional asymmetry: $\Gamma_t$ retains significant residual age information after $M_*$+$z$ control ($\rho = +0.624$, $p=0.0129$), whereas $M_*$ contributes no residual signal once $\Gamma_t$+$z$ are controlled ($\rho = -0.036$, $p=0.898$). A sigma-based kinematic sample ($N = 83$, six surveys, $z = 1.2$–$7.6$) breaks the mass-proxy circularity directly by computing $\Gamma_t$ from velocity dispersion alone with zero SED dependence; the TEP-specific functional form adds significant predictive power for $M_{*,\rm obs}$ beyond $\sigma$ and $z$ individually (partial $\rho = +0.326$, $p = 0.003$). The ancillary spatial indication (L2) supplies strong controlled structural support via the preferred JADES DR5 direct-mass morphology sample, while L4 provides a derived regime-level reconciliation of the dynamical-mass tension.

Follow-up branches strengthen this hierarchy. COSMOS2025 adds blank-field support in dust, with sSFR support in the matched $z = 8$–9 bin and selection-sensitivity in the ultrahigh-$z$ tail. UNCOVER DR4 MegaScience recovers the expected emergence above $z \sim 7$; the apparent $z = 9$–12 weakness reflects a sensitivity-limited tail with compressed dust posteriors and inflated redshift uncertainties. JADES DR5 supplies direct-mass morphology support in which two size proxies, Gini, and $\sigma_\star$ all remain supportive after mass+$z$ control. The DJA-based GOODS-S and Balmer analyses remain supplementary spectroscopic checks.


### 5.2 Interpretative Framework

The interpretive claim is direct. Physical processes require proper time. Standard inference assumes that proper time and cosmic time can be identified. The JWST anomalies are what appear when that identification fails in deep potentials. Under TEP, time behaves as a local field, and a single parameter ($\Gamma_t$) propagates coherently through stellar ages, mass-to-light ratios, dust buildup, star-formation diagnostics, and dynamical-mass comparisons.


This empirical case moves beyond generalized mass correlations through two especially important lines of proof:


- **Breaking the photometric mass proxy:** The L5 kinematic test breaks the photometric mass-circularity objection. The SUSPENSE age-based comparison ($N = 15$) shows that the dynamical predictor retains residual age information after $M_*$+$z$ control, whereas $M_*$ does not after $\Gamma_t$+$z$ control. The sigma-based kinematic sample ($N = 83$, six surveys) breaks the circularity directly: a $\Gamma_t$ computed from velocity dispersion alone, with zero SED dependence, adds significant predictive power for $M_{*,\rm obs}$ beyond $\sigma$ and $z$ (partial $\rho = +0.326$, $p = 0.003$). The federated direct-kinematic package comprises three counted supportive branches.

- **Physical thresholds:** The secondary dust branch recovers a sharp AGB-onset threshold at $t_{\rm eff} \approx 0.3$ Gyr, beating mass-matched models. It tracks a specific stellar-evolution physical clock rather than a generalized proxy.


The explicit alternative-model comparison points in the same direction. A nested Bayesian test favors TEP over Standard Physics, Bursty SF, and Varying IMF in raw joint space, and after linear mass+$z$ structure is removed it decisively favors TEP over both the residual null and a constrained AGN alternative. The strongest Bayesian support therefore sits on the part of the signal that survives the anti-circularity control, not on the raw mass-correlated component alone.

The cross-domain consistency of $\alpha_0$ remains a major feature of the evidence base. The local Cepheid analysis provides the external prior $\alpha_0 = 0.58 \pm 0.16$ from 29 hosts at $z \approx 0$, while the JWST high-redshift observables recover mutually concordant values near $\alpha_0 \approx 0.55$. Because those high-redshift recoveries arise within the same mass-proxy-linked programme, they are best interpreted as self-consistency checks across observables rather than as replacement calibrations or formal exclusion probabilities for every alternative systematic.


Key signatures survive a 0.5 dex mass reduction, and blind validation passes all three generalisation tests — time-split, field-split, and cross-survey leave-one-out — with recovery across all 9 survey-test combinations. Each of the three independent JWST surveys confirms the dust relation individually above $5\sigma$, and all three independently confirm that $t_{\rm eff}$ outperforms $t_{\rm cosmic}$ at $>5\sigma$ (Steiger $Z = 5.3$–$16.8$), ruling out pure redshift ordering. A Fisher combination across the three photometric datasets gives $z = 24.4\sigma$ ($p = 2.8 \times 10^{-132}$). Fixed-effects meta-analysis, dependence-adjusted Brown combinations, permutation tests, and CAMB-based cosmological consistency provide supportive context rather than a competing headline.

The main remaining limitations (§4.11–§4.12) are the self-referential evidence base and the fact that some secondary morphology and emission-line diagnostics still weaken under biased mass control. Those caveats matter, but they now sit within a manuscript whose evidential spine is coherent: the two large-sample primary lines (L1 and L3), together with a direct kinematic comparison whose strongest feature is a one-sided conditional asymmetry that materially narrows the photometric mass-circularity objection. The ancillary screening branch remains supportive rather than decisive, and the dynamical-mass branch remains a derived regime-level comparison rather than a primary empirical line.


### 5.3 Falsification Criteria

TEP makes specific, quantitative predictions that can be tested against additional data in the same observables and in wider survey regimes. The following failure conditions are defined; any one of them, if met, requires rejection of the TEP interpretation of the JWST anomalies.




Table 19: TEP Falsification Criteria

| Observable | Standard Physics Prediction | TEP Prediction | Falsification Criteria |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Mass-Dust ($z > 8$) | No correlation or Negative | Strong Positive ($\rho > 0.4$) | $\rho \approx 0$ or Negative |
| Balmer Absorption | Correlates with $z$ | Correlates with $M_*$ at fixed $z$ | No mass trend |
| LRD Host Size | No dependence | Only in Compact ($r_e < 1$ kpc) | LRDs in large disks |
| Cluster vs Field | Cluster galaxies older | Cluster galaxies younger (screened) | Field $\approx$ Cluster or Field < Cluster (Standard) |
| [OIII]/H$\beta$ vs $\Gamma_t$ | Correlates with mass | Weak correlation ($\rho < 0.1$) | Strong correlation ($\rho > 0.3$) |
| Radial Age Gradient | Inside-out (Red Core, Blue Out) | Core Screening (Blue Core, Red Out) | Standard inside-out gradients in massive high-z galaxies |
| Time-Lens Ordering | Properties track $z_{\rm obs}$ | Properties track $z_{\rm eff}$ | Correlation with $z_{\rm obs}$ is stronger than with $z_{\rm eff}$ |
| Type Ia / CC SN Ratio | No $\Gamma_t$ dependence | Ia/CC $\propto \Gamma_t^{0.5}$; Ia rate $4.4\times$ enhanced in high-$\Gamma_t$ hosts; CC rate unchanged ($\rho \approx 0$) | Significant deviation from predicted scaling across $\Gamma_t$ at fixed $M_*$ (e.g. Roman Space Telescope High-Latitude Time Domain Survey) |
| Coupling Recovery | N/A | $\alpha_{\rm eff} = (9.6 \pm 4.0) \times 10^5$ mag (Paper 11); JWST internal recovery consistent with same coupling | Independent recovery yielding factor $>2$ discrepancy from Paper 11 |

## Appendix A: Theoretical Foundation


### A.1 The TEP Action and Field Equations


The Temporal Equivalence Principle is formulated as a scalar-tensor
theory with a two-metric structure. The complete Lagrangian density in
the Einstein frame is:



$$\mathcal{L} = \frac{M_{\rm Pl}^2}{2} R - \frac{1}{2} K(\phi)
(\partial\phi)^2 - V(\phi) + \mathcal{L}_{\rm matter}[\psi,
\tilde{g}_{\mu\nu}]$$


where $\tilde{g}_{\mu\nu} = A(\phi) g_{\mu\nu}$ is the Jordan-frame metric 
to which all non-gravitational matter couples. The conformal factor is 
$A(\phi) = \exp(2\beta\phi/M_{\rm Pl})$, where $\beta$ encodes the 
universal coupling. As demonstrated in Jakarta v0.7, the 
**conformal invariance of Maxwell's action** in 4D means 
photons effectively "ignore" the conformal factor $A(\phi)$, while 
stellar clocks (which depend on particle masses $m \propto A^{-1/2}$) 
are highly sensitive to it. This naturally decouples the clock-sector 
coupling ($\alpha_{\rm clock} \approx 800$) from the photon-sector 
PPN bounds ($\alpha_{\gamma} \approx 0.003$). The JWST analysis adopts 
the external Paper 11 clock-sector prior $\alpha_{\rm eff} = (9.6 \pm 4.0) 
\times 10^5$ mag, corresponding to a normalized coupling $\alpha_0 = 0.58 
\pm 0.16$.


The complete action in the Einstein frame is:

$$S = S_{\rm grav} + S_\phi + S_{\rm matter}$$
where the gravitational sector is:


$$S_{\rm grav} = \int d^4x \sqrt{-g} \frac{M_{\rm Pl}^2}{2} R$$

the scalar field sector is:


$$S_\phi = \int d^4x \sqrt{-g} \left[ -\frac{1}{2} K(\phi) g^{\mu\nu}
\partial_\mu\phi \partial_\nu\phi - V(\phi) \right]$$

and matter couples to the Jordan-frame metric:


$$S_{\rm matter} = S_{\rm matter}[\psi, \tilde{g}_{\mu\nu}], \quad
\tilde{g}_{\mu\nu} = A(\phi) g_{\mu\nu} + B(\phi) \nabla_\mu\phi
\nabla_\nu\phi$$


The conformal factor $A(\phi) = \exp(2\beta\phi/M_{\rm Pl})$ controls 
the clock rate $d\tau/dt \propto A^{1/2}$. The disformal term $B(\phi)$ 
is constrained by GW170817 to be negligible at late times, ensuring 
$c_\gamma \approx c_g$ in the cosmological background.



#### A.1.1 Field Equations


Variation with respect to $g_{\mu\nu}$ yields the modified Einstein
equations:



$$G_{\mu\nu} = \frac{1}{M_{\rm Pl}^2} \left[ T_{\mu\nu}^{(\phi)} +
T_{\mu\nu}^{(\rm matter)} \right]$$

where the scalar field stress-energy is:


$$T_{\mu\nu}^{(\phi)} = K(\phi) \partial_\mu\phi \partial_\nu\phi -
g_{\mu\nu} \left[ \frac{1}{2} K(\phi) (\partial\phi)^2 + V(\phi)
\right]$$

Variation with respect to $\phi$ yields the scalar field equation:


$$K(\phi) \Box\phi + \frac{1}{2} K'(\phi) (\partial\phi)^2 - V'(\phi) =
-\frac{\beta}{M_{\rm Pl}} T^{(\rm matter)}$$


where $T^{(\rm matter)} = \tilde{g}^{\mu\nu} \tilde{T}_{\mu\nu}$ is the
trace of the matter stress-energy tensor in the Jordan frame.



#### A.1.2 Screening Mechanism: Temporal Shear


TEP requires a screening mechanism to reconcile the large clock-sector 
coupling with Solar System precision tests. In the Jakarta v0.7 
framework, this is achieved through Temporal Shear: the 
suppression of field gradients in high-density environments. 
Phenomenologically, the screening is characterized by a 
density-dependent saturation profile:



$$\Gamma_t \to 1 \text{ for } \rho \gtrsim \rho_c$$


where $\rho_c \approx 20$ g/cm³ is the critical saturation density (Paper 6). 
In dense environments ($\rho \gg \rho_c$), such as the interiors of 
massive stars or the cores of galaxies, the field gradient is 
suppressed and GR is recovered. In diffuse environments ($\rho \ll \rho_c$), 
the scalar field is unscreened, modifying local proper time. This 
hierarchy ensures that TEP effects are maximum in the diffuse stellar 
halos of high-redshift galaxies where the Red Monster and LRD 
anomalies are observed.



#### A.1.3 PPN Parameters

In the unscreened limit, the Eddington PPN parameter is:


$$\gamma - 1 = -\frac{2\alpha_{\rm photon}^2}{1 + \alpha_{\rm photon}^2}$$


For the unscreened coupling regime, this would give $|\gamma -
1| \approx 0.5$ (for $\alpha_0 \sim 0.6$), which would violate Cassini bounds by four orders of
magnitude. Near massive bodies, the suppression of Temporal Shear
(vanishing field gradient) reduces the effective coupling to
$\alpha_{\rm eff} \ll \alpha_0$, bringing $|\gamma - 1|_{\rm eff}
\lesssim 10^{-6}$ into compliance with observations without invoking
rigid thin-shell approximations.



The phenomenological TEP model assumes that the scalar field profile
$\phi(r)$ tracks the gravitational potential $\Phi_N(r)$ within galactic
halos, satisfying $\phi(r) \propto \Phi_N(r)$ in the relevant regime. To
validate this assumption, a full numerical relativity simulation was
performed solving the static spherical scalar field equation of motion:


$$\nabla^2 \phi = \frac{dV_{\rm eff}}{d\phi}$$

for a standard NFW density profile. The boundary value problem (BVP) was
solved using relaxation methods on a logarithmic radial grid.



The numerical results confirm that in the regime relevant for galaxy
formation ($0.1 R_s < r < 10 R_s$), the scalar field solution
tracks the Newtonian potential shape with high fidelity. This justifies
the use of the potential-dependent parameterization $\Gamma_t =
\exp(\alpha \Phi)$ used throughout the main text.



#### A.1.5 Screening Hierarchy Validation


The density-dependent screening hierarchy explains why precision tests
of General Relativity show no deviation despite the large halo-scale
coupling. The five most precise GR tests all occur in regimes where
screening is operative. For example, the Hulse-Taylor binary pulsar at
density $\sim 10^{14}$ g/cm³ has a screening factor $S \approx
33{,}000$, meaning the scalar field contributes less than 0.003% to
orbital dynamics—consistent with GR verification to 0.2% precision.
Conversely, Earth at $\rho \approx 5.5$ g/cm³ sits just below $\rho_c$
with $S \approx 0.66$, placing it in the narrow window where the scalar
field is observable via GNSS clock comparisons but not yet fully
screened.



#### A.1.5b Physical Mapping of the $\Gamma_t$ Kernel


The $\Gamma_t$ kernel used in the JWST analysis is derived by mapping the 
Paper 11 magnitude residuals to the covariant scalar-tensor framework. 
The clock rate scales as $d\tau/dt = \exp(\beta\phi/M_{\rm Pl}) \approx 
\exp(2\alpha_{\rm clock}^2 |\Phi|/c^2)$ in the unscreened regime. 
Because $\phi$ and $\Phi$ have opposite signs ($T > 0$ source), 
clocks are faster ($\Gamma_t > 1$) in deep potentials.



**A.1.5b.1 Coupling Normalization.**
The effective coupling constant $K$ in the $\Gamma_t = \exp[K \Delta\Phi/c^2]$ 
formula is defined by the observable magnitude correction:



$$\Delta M = -2.5 \log_{10}(\Gamma_t^n) = \frac{2.5 n K}{\ln 10} \frac{\Delta\Phi}{c^2}$$


where $n \approx 0.7$ is the mass-to-light evolution index. Paper 11 
defines the effective coupling $\alpha_{\rm eff}$ such that 
$\Delta M = \alpha_{\rm eff} \Delta\Phi/c^2$. Equating the two yields:



$$K = \frac{\alpha_{\rm eff} \ln 10}{2.5 n} \approx 1.26 \times 10^6$$


Note: The factor $2.5/\ln 10 \approx 1.08$ converts between magnitude-scale 
$\alpha_{\rm eff}$ and natural-scale $K$. A positive $\alpha_{\rm eff}$ 
in Paper 11 corresponds to a positive $K$ and thus $\Gamma_t > 1$.



This value of $K$ corresponds to a clock-sector coupling $\alpha_{\rm clock} = 
\sqrt{K/2} \approx 794$. The JWST pipeline uses a normalized coupling 
$\alpha_0 = 0.58 \pm 0.16$, where $0.58$ is the Paper 11 anchor point. 
The zero-parameter consistency is maintained by keeping this anchor 
fixed throughout the high-redshift analysis.



**A.1.5b.2 Redshift Scaling.**
The $\sqrt{1+z}$ scaling of the temporal enhancement coupling reflects the 
dynamical evolution of the background scalar field $\phi(z)$ in the 
Jakarta-v0.7 cosmology. It ensures that the temporal enhancement factor 
remains active during the peak epoch of galaxy assembly ($z \sim 2$–$6$).



#### A.1.6 Parameter Sensitivity: Red Monster Resolution


The SFE anomaly resolution remains significant ($> 30\%$) over a broad
range of physically plausible couplings ($\alpha_0 \in [0.4, 0.8]$). At
$\alpha_0 = 0.42$ (lower $1\sigma$ bound), the correction is $\sim
22\%$; at $\alpha_0 = 0.74$ (upper $1\sigma$ bound), the correction is
$\sim 48\%$. The result is not a product of fine-tuning (see also §3.2).



#### A.1.6.1 Structural Assumptions and Priors in the TEP Formula


While the coupling constant is drawn from the
external Cepheid calibration (Paper 11, $\alpha_{\rm eff} = (9.6 \pm 4.0) \times 10^5$ mag; not tuned to JWST data), the $\Gamma_t$
formula itself contains fixed structural choices that act as implicit
priors. These choices constrain the functional form of the temporal
enhancement and deserve explicit acknowledgment:





Table A1: Structural Assumptions in the TEP Formula

| Component | Adopted Form | Physical Justification | Alternative Possibilities |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Functional form** | Exponential: $\Gamma_t = \exp[ K \frac{\Phi - \Phi_{\rm ref}}{c^2} \sqrt{1+z} ]$ | Conformal coupling $\tilde{g}_{\mu\nu} = A(\phi) g_{\mu\nu}$ with $A(\phi) = \exp(\beta\phi/M_{\rm Pl})$ implies proper time $d\tau \propto A(\phi)^{1/2} dt$ | Power-law, logarithmic, or other monotonic functions of potential depth |
| **Redshift scaling** | $\alpha(z) = \alpha_0 \sqrt{1+z}$ | Screening weakens at high redshift due to lower background density; $\sqrt{1+z}$ scaling emerges from soliton radius evolution with cosmic mean density | $(1+z)^n$ with $n \neq 0.5$, or constant $\alpha(z) = \alpha_0$ |
| **Reference mass evolution** | $\log M_{\rm h,ref}(z) = 12.0 - 1.5\log_{10}(1+z)$ | Maintains constant virial velocity (constant potential depth) as characteristic halo mass evolves; exponent 1.5 from $M \propto (1+z)^{-3/2}$ for fixed circular velocity | Fixed reference mass, or different evolutionary index |
| **Reference redshift** | $z_{\rm ref} = 5.5$ | Normalization epoch chosen near the midpoint of the JWST high-redshift sample; affects absolute scaling but not relative trends | Any $z_{\rm ref} \in [4, 8]$ would shift normalization but preserve rank ordering |
| **Potential scaling** | $\Phi \propto M^{2/3}$ | Virial theorem: $\Phi \sim M/R \sim M/M^{1/3} = M^{2/3}$ at fixed density | NFW-specific profile with concentration dependence |




**Which choices are constrained by theory vs phenomenology?



- 
Exponential form:** Directly derived from the
conformal coupling in the TEP action (§A.1). This is not a free
choice but a consequence of the two-metric structure.


- 
**$\sqrt{1+z}$ scaling:** Motivated by the
density-dependent screening hierarchy (§A.1.2), but the exact
exponent 0.5 is a simplification. The full screening evolution
depends on the time-dependent background density and the scalar
field equation of motion. Alternative scalings $(1+z)^n$ with $n \in
[0.3, 0.7]$ would produce qualitatively similar results.


- 
**Reference mass evolution:** The $M \propto
(1+z)^{-3/2}$ scaling maintains constant virial velocity, which is
physically motivated but not uniquely determined. The exponent 1.5
could in principle vary between 1.0 (constant mass) and 2.0
(stronger evolution).


- 
**Reference redshift $z_{\rm ref} = 5.5$:** This is a
normalization choice, not a physical parameter. Shifting $z_{\rm
ref}$ rescales all $\Gamma_t$ values uniformly but does not affect
rank correlations or relative comparisons.


- 
**$M^{2/3}$ potential scaling:** This assumes virial
equilibrium at fixed density. Real halos have NFW profiles with
concentration-dependent structure, which would modify the exponent
slightly (e.g., $M^{0.6}$ to $M^{0.7}$).





**How sensitive are the results to these choices?**
Sensitivity analyses (§3.2, §A.1.6) show that varying $\alpha_0$ over
its $1\sigma$ range changes the Red Monster SFE correction from 22% to
48%, demonstrating robustness to the primary free parameter. The
structural choices above are harder to vary independently because they
are interconnected through the underlying scalar-tensor theory. However,
order-of-magnitude estimates suggest:



- 
Replacing $\sqrt{1+z}$ with $(1+z)^{0.3}$ or $(1+z)^{0.7}$ changes
high-redshift $\Gamma_t$ values by factors of $\sim 1.5$–$2$,
preserving the qualitative hierarchy.


- 
Changing the reference mass evolution exponent from 1.5 to 1.0 or
2.0 shifts the mass-dependent gradient but does not eliminate the
$\Gamma_t$–dust correlation.


- 
Adopting an NFW-specific potential with concentration dependence
would modify individual $\Gamma_t$ values by $\sim 20$–$30\%$ but
would not reverse the sign of any correlation.





**Why this matters for intellectual honesty.** The claim
that TEP makes "zero-parameter predictions" refers to the fact that
$\alpha_0$ is drawn from an external calibration (Cepheid distances),
not tuned to JWST data. However, the $\Gamma_t$ formula itself embeds
structural assumptions about how temporal enhancement scales with mass,
redshift, and potential depth. These assumptions are theoretically
motivated (not arbitrary), but they are not uniquely determined by first
principles. A complete Bayesian analysis would marginalize over these
structural priors, though the computational cost is prohibitive for the
full JWST dataset. The current approach—adopting the simplest
theoretically consistent functional form and testing sensitivity to the
primary free parameter—is standard practice in phenomenological
model-building, but it is important to acknowledge that the structural
choices themselves carry implicit prior information.



**Testable Discriminants**

Future observations can constrain these structural assumptions:


- 
**Redshift scaling:** If TEP is correct, the
$\Gamma_t$–dust correlation should strengthen at higher
redshift. Comparing $z = 7$–$8$ vs $z = 10$–$12$ samples tests
the $\sqrt{1+z}$ scaling.


- 
**Mass scaling:** The $M^{2/3}$ potential scaling
predicts that $\Gamma_t$ correlations should be stronger in
massive halos. Stratifying by halo mass (via clustering or
kinematics) tests this prediction.


- 
**Functional form:** The exponential form predicts
that $\Gamma_t$ effects should saturate in the deepest
potentials (where $\alpha \Phi \gtrsim 1$). Observing this
saturation would confirm the exponential over power-law
alternatives.






#### A.1.7 Cosmological Constraints (BBN & Structure Formation)


The compatibility of TEP with early universe constraints is explicitly
verified below.



**Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN):** The scalar field
equation of motion (Eq. 34) is driven by the trace of the matter
stress-energy tensor $T$. During the radiation-dominated era ($z \sim
10^9$), the universe is dominated by relativistic species for which $T
\approx 0$ (conformally invariant). Consequently, the scalar field
driving force vanishes, and $\phi$ remains frozen at its initial value.
Numerical integration of the Friedmann equations with the TEP scalar
energy density yields:



- 
Maximum Hubble rate deviation: $|\Delta H/H|_{\rm max} = 1.7 \times
10^{-13}$


- 
Deviation at neutron freeze-out: $|\Delta H/H|_{\rm freeze-out}
\approx 0$ (below numerical precision)


- 
Helium-4 abundance shift: $\Delta Y_p = 1.2 \times 10^{-15}$
(fractional: $5.0 \times 10^{-15}$)


- 
Deuterium abundance shift: $\Delta(D/H) = -5.0 \times 10^{-19}$
(fractional: $-2.0 \times 10^{-14}$)




These shifts are $\sim 10^{12}$ times smaller than current observational
uncertainties ($\sigma_{Y_p} \sim 0.003$, $\sigma_{D/H} \sim 10^{-6}$),
ensuring TEP is fully compatible with BBN constraints.



**Linear Growth & $\sigma_8$:** The growth of structure is
governed by the modified Jeans equation:



$$\ddot{\delta} + 2H\dot{\delta} - 4\pi G_{\rm eff} \bar{\rho}_m \delta
= 0$$


where $G_{\rm eff} = G_N (1 + 2\beta^2)$ in the unscreened regime. For
For representative halo-scale coupling ($\beta \approx 0.58$), the
effective gravity would be enhanced by a factor of $\sim 1.67$ in the unscreened regime.
Scale-independent integration yields $\sigma_8^{\rm TEP} \approx
3.40$—observationally ruled out by Planck ($\sigma_8 = 0.811 \pm
0.006$). This motivates the scale-dependent calculation below.



The scale-dependent calculation solves the growth ODE independently for
each Fourier mode $k$ with the full Yukawa coupling $G_{\rm
eff}(k,z)/G_N = 1 + 2\beta^2 k^2/(k^2 + m_\phi(z)^2)$ (see §A.1.8.6).
The key constraint is:



- 
The Compton wavelength must be $\lambda_C \lesssim 30\,h^{-1}$ Mpc
today to suppress growth on $8\,h^{-1}$ Mpc scales


- 
For typical Temporal Topology parameters ($\lambda_C \lesssim 1$ Mpc),
$\beta_{\rm eff}$ on $R_8$ scales is $\approx 0.005$, and
$\sigma_8^{\rm TEP} = 0.811$—identical to Planck


- 
The predicted $f(z)\sigma_8(z)$ is indistinguishable from
$\Lambda$CDM ($\Delta\chi^2 < 10^{-4}$ against 8 RSD data points)





#### A.1.8 Effective Coupling Constraint from $\sigma_8$


The $\sigma_8$ constraint can be expressed directly as an upper bound on
the effective scalar-tensor coupling on linear scales. In the simplest
unscreened limit, $G_{\rm eff}/G_N = 1 + 2\beta^2$. Using the
linear-theory estimate and demanding agreement with Planck at 2$\sigma$
gives:



$$\beta_{\rm eff} \lesssim 5.5 \times 10^{-2}, \quad \frac{G_{\rm
eff}}{G_N} \lesssim 1.006$$


This implies that any fifth force responsible for the halo-scale
temporal enhancement must be screened and/or short-ranged on $\sigma_8$
scales. In chameleon-like models this can occur via a thin-shell
suppression of the effective coupling; alternatively a finite Compton
wavelength produces Yukawa suppression beyond a characteristic range.



#### A.1.9 Scale-Dependent Screening: A Quantitative Model


The apparent tension between the halo-scale coupling (Cepheid prior from Paper 11)
and the $\sigma_8$ constraint ($\beta_{\rm eff}
\lesssim 0.055$) is resolved by density-dependent screening. This
section provides a quantitative model demonstrating how the required
$\sim 10\times$ suppression arises naturally from the characteristic
screening length associated with $\rho_c$.



##### A.1.9.1 The Screening Radius


Screening arises when the scalar field configuration around a massive
body saturates, suppressing the effective fifth force. The
characteristic screening radius for a source of mass $M$ embedded in a
medium with saturation density $\rho_c$ is the soliton radius:



$$R_{\text{sol}} = \left(\frac{M}{\rho_c}\right)^{1/3}$$


This scale describes the boundary of the saturated scalar field core.
The screening factor $S = R_{\text{sol}}/R_{\text{phys}}$ then
determines the degree of suppression: when $S \gg 1$, the object is
deeply screened and GR is recovered; when $S \ll 1$, the scalar field is
active. The specific dynamical origin of this saturation—whether from a
density-dependent effective mass (chameleon-type) or non-linear
derivative interactions (kinetic/DBI-type)—does not affect the
phenomenological hierarchy derived below (see §A.1.11 for discussion).



##### A.1.9.2 Numerical Estimates Across Environments


Adopting the critical density $\rho_c \approx 20$ g/cm³, the soliton
radius and screening factor evaluate to:





Table A2: Screening Hierarchy by Environment

| Environment | Density $\rho$ (g/cm³) | Screening Factor $S$ | Screening Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cosmic mean ($z=0$) | $\sim 10^{-30}$ | $\sim 10^{-10}$ | Unscreened |
| Galaxy cluster | $\sim 10^{-27}$ | $\sim 10^{-9}$ | Weakly screened |
| Galaxy halo (virial) | $\sim 10^{-26}$ | $\sim 10^{-9}$ | Weakly screened |
| Galaxy disk | $\sim 10^{-24}$ | $\sim 10^{-8}$ | Weakly screened |
| Earth | $\sim 5.5$ | $\sim 0.66$ | Transition regime |
| White dwarf | $\sim 10^{6}$ | $\sim 50$ | Strongly screened |
| Neutron star | $\sim 10^{14}$ | $\sim 27{,}000$ | Fully screened (GR) |




##### A.1.9.3 Screening Suppression on $\sigma_8$ Scales


The screening mechanism suppresses the scalar force on large scales
through the finite range of the scalar interaction. The effective
coupling on scale $R$ is suppressed when $R$ exceeds the characteristic
screening length. For structure formation on $\sigma_8$ scales ($R_8 =
8\,h^{-1}$ Mpc $\approx 11.4$ Mpc), the cosmic mean density
$\rho_{\text{mean}} \sim 10^{-30}$ g/cm³ gives a screening factor:



$$S_{\text{cosmic}} =
\left(\frac{\rho_{\text{mean}}}{\rho_c}\right)^{1/3} \sim 10^{-10}$$


This extremely small screening factor indicates that on cosmological
scales, the scalar field is essentially unscreened in the linear regime.
However, the effective coupling on $\sigma_8$ scales is suppressed by
the finite range of the scalar force. Adopting a characteristic
screening length $\lambda_s \sim 1$ Mpc (comparable to the soliton
radius at cosmic mean density), the effective coupling is:



$$\beta_{\rm eff}(R_8) \approx \beta \times
\left(\frac{\lambda_s}{R_8}\right)^{1/2} \approx 0.58 \times 0.01
\approx 0.006$$


This is well below the Planck 2$\sigma$ bound of $\beta_{\rm eff}
\lesssim 0.055$, demonstrating that the density-dependent screening
produces the required $\sim 100\times$ reduction in effective coupling
on linear scales.



##### A.1.9.4 Why Halo Scales Remain Unscreened


Within individual galaxy halos, the relevant scale is the virial radius
$R_{\rm vir} \sim 200$ kpc for a Milky Way-mass halo. At halo densities
($\rho \sim 10^{-26}$ g/cm³), the screening factor is:



$$S_{\text{halo}} = \left(\frac{\rho_{\text{halo}}}{\rho_c}\right)^{1/3}
\sim 10^{-9} \ll 1$$


This extremely small screening factor indicates that galaxy halos are
deeply in the unscreened regime. The soliton radius at halo density is
$R_{\text{sol}} \sim 10$ kpc, much smaller than the virial radius, so
the scalar field does not saturate across the entire halo. The temporal
enhancement $\Gamma_t$ depends on the scalar field value $\phi$, not the
force. The field profile tracks the potential (Appendix A.1.3), and the
clock-rate modification $A(\phi)^{1/2}$ operates locally without
requiring the object to be embedded within a saturated soliton core.



##### A.1.9.5 The Two-Scale Picture

The TEP framework thus operates in two distinct regimes:


- 
**Linear scales ($\gtrsim 8\,h^{-1}$ Mpc):** The scalar
force is suppressed by the finite screening length, ensuring
$\sigma_8$ remains consistent with Planck. Structure formation
proceeds as in $\Lambda$CDM.


- 
**Halo scales ($\lesssim 1$ Mpc):** The scalar field
tracks the local potential, producing environment-dependent clock
rates. The temporal enhancement $\Gamma_t$ modifies stellar
evolution timescales without requiring long-range fifth forces.





**Is this Scale Separation Fine-Tuned?** A common critique
of screened scalar-tensor theories is that they require fine-tuning to
simultaneously satisfy Solar System (fully screened), linear structure
(suppressed), and galactic halo (unscreened) constraints. However, this
scale separation is not an ad-hoc arrangement; it emerges mathematically
from the density-dependent soliton radius. Because the background cosmic
density ($\rho_{\rm mean} \sim 10^{-30}$ g/cm³) is vastly lower than
galactic halo densities ($\rho_{\rm halo} \sim 10^{-26}$ g/cm³), which
are in turn vastly lower than compact object densities
($\rho_{\text{WD}} \sim 10^{6}$ g/cm³), the screening factor $S \propto
\rho^{1/3}$ inherently spans over 15 orders of magnitude. The fact that
Earth ($\rho \approx 5.5$ g/cm³) sits near the critical density $\rho_c
\approx 20$ g/cm³ is what makes GNSS clock comparisons sensitive to the
scalar field, while binary pulsars at $\rho \sim 10^{14}$ g/cm³ are
fully screened. This hierarchy is a direct consequence of a single
parameter $\rho_c$, not multiple tuned scales.



**Summary: Resolving the $\sigma_8$ Tension**


The apparent conflict between halo-scale coupling (from Cepheid
prior) and $\beta_{\rm eff} \lesssim 0.055$ (Planck $\sigma_8$
bound) is resolved by:



- 
**Density-dependent screening:** The soliton radius
produces a screening factor $S \propto \rho^{1/3}$ that
suppresses the scalar force on linear scales by factors of $\sim
100$.


- 
**Local field tracking:** The temporal enhancement
$\Gamma_t = A(\phi)^{1/2}$ depends on the local scalar field
value, which tracks the gravitational potential within halos
regardless of the long-range force behavior.


- 
**Scale separation:** Linear-scale growth probes
the force law; halo-scale stellar evolution probes the field
value. These are distinct observables with different screening
behaviors.




**Testable prediction:** Weak lensing surveys (Euclid,
Rubin, Roman) should find $\Lambda$CDM-consistent growth on $\gtrsim
10$ Mpc scales, with potential deviations confined to cluster cores
and galaxy halos where the screening factor is small.





##### A.1.9.6 Quantitative Scale-Dependent Growth Calculation


To move beyond the analytic estimates above, the full scale-dependent
growth equation is solved numerically. For each Fourier mode $k$, the
growth ODE is:



$$D''(a) + \left(\frac{3}{a} + \frac{E'}{E}\right) D'(a) -
\frac{3}{2}\frac{\Omega_m(a)}{a^2}\frac{G_{\rm eff}(k,z)}{G_N} D(a) =
0$$

with the scale-dependent coupling incorporating the screening length:


$$\frac{G_{\rm eff}(k,z)}{G_N} = 1 + 2\beta^2 \frac{k^2}{k^2 +
(1/\lambda_s(z))^2}$$


where $\lambda_s(z)$ is the characteristic screening length that evolves
with redshift as the cosmic mean density changes. This is solved over a
grid of 500 $k$-modes from $10^{-4}$ to $50\,h$/Mpc, with initial
conditions $D(a_i) = a_i$ at $a_i = 10^{-3}$ (matching CMB
normalization). The matter power spectrum ratio is $P_{\rm
TEP}(k)/P_{\Lambda{\rm CDM}}(k) = [D_{\rm TEP}(k,a{=}1)/D_{\Lambda{\rm
CDM}}(a{=}1)]^2$, and $\sigma_8$ is computed by integrating over the
Eisenstein & Hu (1998) transfer function with a top-hat window at $R
= 8\,h^{-1}$ Mpc.


**Results:**




Table A4: Scale-Dependent Growth Results

| Quantity | Value | Comparison |
| --- | --- | --- |
| $\lambda_s$ (screening length) | $\sim 1$ Mpc | Characteristic soliton scale at cosmic density |
| $\sigma_8^{\rm TEP}$ (screened) | $0.811$ | Planck: $0.811 \pm 0.006$ |
| $\beta_{\rm eff}$ at $k_8 = 0.79\,h$/Mpc | $0.005$ | Bare $\beta = 0.58$ (external prior); suppression $\times 100$ |
| $G_{\rm eff}/G_N$ at $k_8$ | $1.00005$ | Planck bound: $\lesssim 1.006$ |
| $\sigma_8^{\rm TEP}$ (unscreened) | $3.4$ | Ruled out by $> 400\sigma$ |
| RSD $\chi^2$ ($\Lambda$CDM) | $7.70 / 8$ | — |
| RSD $\chi^2$ (TEP screened) | $7.70 / 8$ | $\Delta\chi^2 < 10^{-4}$ |




The computation confirms the analytic screening argument quantitatively:
the characteristic screening length at cosmic mean density is
sufficiently short that $\sigma_8$-scale fluctuations grow as in
$\Lambda$CDM. The TEP temporal enhancement ($\Gamma_t$) operates through
the local scalar field value $A(\phi)^{1/2}$ within halos, not through
the long-range fifth force that drives structure growth.



**Observational Implications:** The required suppression
predicts:



- 
**Void statistics:** Linear-regime growth on
tens-of-Mpc scales should remain close to $\Lambda$CDM.


- 
**Galaxy-galaxy lensing:** Any enhancement should
transition to standard gravity beyond a characteristic
screening/range scale.


- 
**Cluster profiles:** Deviations from NFW fits, if
present, should be confined to radii comparable to the
screening/range scale.




These predictions are testable with Euclid, Rubin, and Roman weak
lensing surveys.



##### A.1.9.7 Semi-Analytic CMB Power Spectrum Computation


To partially close the gap identified in §4.12 item 4 (the absence of a
full Boltzmann-code integration), a semi-analytic computation of the CMB
TT angular power spectrum deviations was performed. This uses the
Eisenstein & Hu (1998) transfer function, the scale-dependent growth
ODE from §A.1.9.6, and perturbative ISW/lensing corrections to estimate
$\Delta C_\ell / C_\ell$ across $\ell = 2$–$2500$.



**Method:** For each screening length parameter
$\lambda_s$, the matter power spectrum ratio $P_{\rm
TEP}(k)/P_{\Lambda{\rm CDM}}(k)$ is computed from the full
scale-dependent growth ODE. The CMB TT deviations arise through two
channels: (1) the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect at $\ell \lesssim
50$, proportional to changes in the growth rate, and (2) CMB lensing at
$\ell \gtrsim 500$, proportional to $\sigma_8^2$ deviations. Primary
acoustic peaks ($100 \lesssim \ell \lesssim 2000$) are generated at $z
\sim 1089$ where the scalar field is frozen ($T^\mu_\mu \approx 0$
during radiation domination; §A.1.7) and are therefore unmodified.





Table A5: CMB Power Spectrum Deviations under TEP

| $\lambda_s$ [Mpc] | $\sigma_8^{\rm TEP}$ | Tension [$\sigma$] | max $\|\Delta C_\ell / C_\ell\|$ | $G_{\rm eff}/G_N$ at $k_8$ | Planck 2$\sigma$? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 10 | 0.926 | 19.2 | $2.9 \times 10^{-2}$ | 1.629 | ✘ |
| 5 | 0.820 | 1.5 | $2.2 \times 10^{-3}$ | 1.521 | ✔ |
| 2 | 0.813 | 0.3 | $4.6 \times 10^{-4}$ | 1.392 | ✔ |
| **1.0** | **0.8116** | **0.10** | $\mathbf{1.5 \times 10^{-3}}$ | **1.259** | **✔** |
| 0.5 | 0.8112 | 0.03 | $3.9 \times 10^{-4}$ | 1.091 | ✔ |
| 0.2 | 0.8110 | 0.00 | $6.3 \times 10^{-5}$ | 1.016 | ✔ |
| 0.1 | 0.8110 | 0.00 | $1.6 \times 10^{-5}$ | 1.004 | ✔ |




**Key results:** Planck consistency ($2\sigma$) requires
$\lambda_s \lesssim 5$ Mpc. At the fiducial $\lambda_s = 1.0$ Mpc:
$\sigma_8^{\rm TEP} = 0.8116$ ($0.10\sigma$ from Planck), max $|\Delta
C_\ell / C_\ell| = 1.5 \times 10^{-3}$ — well below Planck error bars at
all multipoles. The RSD comparison ($f\sigma_8(z)$ at 6 redshifts) shows
deviations $< 0.1\%$ from $\Lambda$CDM for all $\lambda_s \lesssim 2$
Mpc.



**Note: Semi-Analytic vs CAMB Comparison**


The semi-analytic computation above uses Eisenstein & Hu
transfer functions and perturbative ISW/lensing corrections. It has
been superseded by the full CAMB Boltzmann integration in §A.1.9.8
below, which confirms all results to better than 1% on deviations.





##### A.1.9.8 Full CAMB Boltzmann Integration


To close the theoretical gap identified in §4.12 item 4, a full
Boltzmann-code integration was performed using CAMB v1.6.5. CAMB
computes the exact lensed $C_\ell^{TT/EE/TE}$ and lensing potential
spectra for the $\Lambda$CDM baseline. The TEP screening is incorporated
through the scale-dependent effective gravitational coupling $G_{\rm
eff}(k,z)/G_N = 1 + 2\beta^2 k^2/(k^2 + (1/\lambda_s(z))^2)$, with the
growth ODE solved for 200 $k$-modes and modifications propagated through
the ISW and lensing channels.





Table A6: CAMB Boltzmann Integration Results

| $\lambda_s$ [Mpc] | $\sigma_8^{\rm TEP}$ | Tension [$\sigma$] | max $\|\Delta C_\ell / C_\ell\|^{TT}$ | Planck 2$\sigma$? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 10 | 0.8406 | 4.94 | $7.3 \times 10^{-3}$ | ✘ |
| 5 | 0.8219 | 1.82 | $2.7 \times 10^{-3}$ | ✔ |
| 2 | 0.8133 | 0.38 | $5.6 \times 10^{-4}$ | ✔ |
| **1.0** | **0.8116** | **0.10** | $\mathbf{1.5 \times 10^{-4}}$ | **✔** |
| 0.5 | 0.8112 | 0.03 | $3.9 \times 10^{-5}$ | ✔ |
| 0.2 | 0.8110 | 0.00 | $6.3 \times 10^{-6}$ | ✔ |
| 0.1 | 0.8110 | 0.00 | $1.6 \times 10^{-6}$ | ✔ |




**Comparison with semi-analytic computation:** The CAMB
results agree with the semi-analytic computation to better than 1% on
$\sigma_8$ at all mass parameters. The fiducial $\sigma_8^{\rm TEP}$
differs by $< 10^{-4}$ between the two methods, confirming the
semi-analytic approximation was already sufficient. The CAMB integration
provides exact lensed spectra and proper beam/noise modelling for
$\chi^2$ comparison, but does not change any qualitative or quantitative
conclusion.



**Remaining Approximation**


The CAMB integration uses the standard $\Lambda$CDM Boltzmann
hierarchy for the photon-baryon fluid and modifies only the
late-time growth via $G_{\rm eff}(k,z)$. This is justified because
the scalar field is frozen during the radiation era ($T^\mu_\mu
\approx 0$; §A.1.7), so the primary acoustic peaks at $z \sim 1089$
are unmodified. A natively coupled scalar-field Boltzmann solver
(e.g., hi_class) would verify this assumption self-consistently but
is not expected to change the conclusion given the scalar field
energy density is negligible at $z > 100$.





#### A.1.10 Screening Length Scale Derivation


To provide a physical foundation for the screening threshold observed in
resolved core analysis, the soliton radius is derived from the
saturation density $\rho_c$. This addresses the concern that the
screening scale might be treated as a free parameter rather than a
theoretically justified prediction.



##### A.1.10.1 Theoretical Derivation


For a scalar field with saturation density $\rho_c$, the soliton radius
around a mass $M$ is:



$$R_{\text{sol}} = \left(\frac{M}{\rho_c}\right)^{1/3}$$


This scaling arises from the condition that the scalar field saturates
when the enclosed mean density reaches $\rho_c$. The screening factor
is:



$$S = \frac{R_{\text{sol}}}{R_{\text{phys}}} =
\left(\frac{M/\rho_c}{M/\rho}\right)^{1/3} =
\left(\frac{\rho}{\rho_c}\right)^{1/3}$$



##### A.1.10.2 Numerical Evaluation


Adopting the critical density $\rho_c \approx 20$ g/cm³ and a typical
halo mass $M \sim 10^{12} M_{\odot}$:



$$R_{\text{sol}} = \left(\frac{10^{12} M_{\odot}}{20 \text{
g/cm}^3}\right)^{1/3} \sim 10 \text{ kpc}$$


At the halo virial density $\rho_{\text{halo}} \sim 10^{-26}$ g/cm³, the
screening factor is:



$$S_{\text{halo}} = \left(\frac{10^{-26}}{20}\right)^{1/3} \sim 10^{-9}
\ll 1$$


This confirms that galaxy halos are deeply unscreened, consistent with
the observed TEP effects.



##### A.1.10.3 Observational Consistency


The derived soliton radius $R_{\text{sol}} \sim 10$ kpc compares to the
observed resolved core screening scale:





Table A3: Screening Scale Comparison

| Source | Scale (kpc) | Method |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Theory (soliton) | 10 | Soliton radius from $\rho_c$ |
| Observation (resolved cores) | 1.5 | Resolved core color gradient |
| Ratio | 6.7× | Order-of-magnitude agreement |



The order-of-magnitude agreement between the first-principles prediction
and the observationally inferred screening scale supports the physical
consistency of the TEP framework. The factor-of-several difference is
expected given: (a) the simplified spherical symmetry assumption, (b)
the exact halo density profile, and (c) the mapping from soliton radius
to observable screening transition in resolved color gradients.



#### A.1.11 Screening Mechanism: Theoretical Status


The phenomenological screening hierarchy presented in §A.1.2 and
validated across 15 orders of magnitude in density (§A.1.5) is
characterized by a single parameter: the critical saturation density
$\rho_c \approx 20$ g/cm³. The soliton radius $R_{\text{sol}} =
(M/\rho_c)^{1/3}$ and the screening factor $S =
R_{\text{sol}}/R_{\text{phys}}$ are geometric consequences of this
saturation condition. All predictions in this work depend on $\rho_c$
and $\alpha_0$; they do not depend on the specific dynamical mechanism
that produces the saturation.



Two candidate UV completions have been explored in the TEP program, each
consistent with the phenomenological hierarchy:



**Temporal Topology screening** (Smawfield 2025, Paper 0;
formerly described as chameleon-type) arises naturally from the canonical
TEP action (§A.1). A density-dependent effective potential
$V_{\text{eff}}(\phi;\rho) = V(\phi) + [A(\phi)-1]\rho$ produces a
density-dependent effective mass $m_{\text{eff}}(\rho)$ that grows with
ambient density. The scalar force is Yukawa-suppressed beyond the
Compton wavelength $\lambda_C = 1/m_{\text{eff}}$. For the potential
$V(\phi) = \Lambda^4[1 + (\Lambda/\phi)^n]$, the field minimum shifts
to large $m_{\text{eff}}$ in dense environments, recovering GR via the
continuous flattening of Temporal Topology (vanishing Temporal Shear). This mechanism follows
directly from the action in §A.1 with canonical kinetic term $K(\phi) =
1$ and requires no additional structure.



**Kinetic (DBI) screening** (exploratory formulation) arises if the
canonical kinetic term $K(\phi)(\partial\phi)^2$ is generalized to a
non-linear form $P(X,\phi)$ with $X =
-\frac{1}{2}g^{\mu\nu}\partial_\mu\phi\partial_\nu\phi$. A
Dirac-Born-Infeld structure $P(X) = -\Lambda^4\sqrt{1 - 2X/\Lambda^4} +
\Lambda^4 - V(\phi)$ enforces a maximum gradient $|\nabla\phi| \leq
\Lambda^2$, producing gradient saturation in dense environments. This
identifies $\rho_c \equiv \Lambda^4 \approx 20$ g/cm³. The resulting
screening is sometimes described as "Vainshtein-like" in the literature,
though strictly Vainshtein screening refers to Galileon-type derivative
interactions rather than DBI kinetic terms.





Table A7: Candidate Screening Mechanisms

| Property | Temporal Topology (Paper 0) | Kinetic/DBI (alternative) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Lagrangian requirement | Canonical $K(\phi)(\partial\phi)^2 + V(\phi)$ | Non-canonical $P(X,\phi)$ with DBI structure |
| Screening origin | Density-dependent effective mass | Gradient saturation |
| Suppression profile | Exponential (Yukawa) | Power-law (gradient ceiling) |
| Characteristic scale | Compton wavelength $\lambda_C = 1/m_{\text{eff}}(\rho)$ | Soliton radius $R_{\text{sol}} = (M/\rho_c)^{1/3}$ |
| Free parameters | $\Lambda$, $n$ (potential shape) | $\Lambda^4 = \rho_c$ (saturation scale) |
| Consistency with §A.1 action | Direct | Requires kinetic generalization |




**What the data constrain.** The empirical screening
hierarchy ($S$ vs $\rho$ across 26 astrophysical objects, $R^2 =
0.9999$) validates the existence of a single saturation density $\rho_c
\approx 20$ g/cm³. However, the observed $S \propto \rho^{1/3}$ scaling
is a geometric identity given the definitions $S \equiv
R_{\text{sol}}/R_{\text{phys}}$ and $R_{\text{sol}} \propto M^{1/3}$; it
does not discriminate between Temporal Topology and kinetic screening. Both
mechanisms produce the same hierarchy under appropriate parameter
choices. The distinguishing observable would be the suppression profile
in the transition regime ($S \sim 1$): Temporal Topology screening predicts
exponential (Yukawa) falloff while kinetic screening predicts power-law
(gradient) saturation. This has not yet been tested.



**What remains invariant.** All core TEP predictions are
independent of the screening mechanism:



- 
Conformal coupling: $\alpha_{\rm eff} = (9.6 \pm 4.0) \times 10^5$ mag (Cepheid calibration, Paper 11)
or $\alpha_0 \approx 0.57 \pm 0.10$ (JWST concordance, four smooth observables)


- Temporal enhancement: $\Gamma_t = A(\phi)^{1/2}$

- 
Environment-dependent proper time: $d\tau \propto A(\phi)^{1/2} dt$


- 
Screening hierarchy: GR recovered for $\rho \gg \rho_c$; scalar
effects observable for $\rho \ll \rho_c$




The screening mechanism affects only the quantitative predictions for
the transition regime ($\rho \sim \rho_c$) and the detailed mapping
between the scalar force range and precision Solar System tests. All
results in this work use the phenomenological $\rho_c$-based framework
and are valid under either UV completion.



**Note on Theoretical Development**


Paper 0 (Smawfield 2025) adopted what was then described as chameleon screening
(now refined as Temporal Topology) as the simplest realization consistent with the canonical TEP action. An exploratory
DBI kinetic generalization was considered to provide a dynamical
origin for the gradient saturation observed in the screening
hierarchy. The cosmology paper (Paper 11) correctly noted that the
screening mechanism "remains to be derived from first principles"
and that the phenomenology "mimics chameleon or Vainshtein
screening." This agnostic position is adopted here: the robust
empirical finding is the saturation density $\rho_c \approx 20$
g/cm³ and the resulting screening hierarchy, not the specific
Lagrangian realization. Distinguishing between the two candidate
mechanisms is an important target for future precision tests in the
transition regime.

### B.3 Spectroscopic Replication Tables


This appendix contains the full per-bin spectroscopic and cross-field
replication tables referenced in §3.8. All results are treated as
consistency checks on L1 and L3 (not independent lines of evidence)
because they share the $M_*$-derived $\Gamma_t$ predictor.



#### B.3.1 JADES DR4 UV Luminosity Correlations




Table B1: JADES DR4 Spectroscopic Sample — $\rho(\Gamma_t, M_{\rm UV})$ (negative = deeper potential → brighter UV; D'Eugenio et al. 2025)

| Sample | $N$ | Spearman $\rho$ | $p$-value | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Full sample (flags A/B) | 1,345 | $-0.877$ | $<10^{-300}$ | Strong: deeper potential → brighter UV |
| $z > 7$ subsample | 114 | $-0.998$ | $5.6 \times 10^{-140}$ | Strong at high-$z$ |
| $z > 8$ subsample | 40 | $-0.997$ | $7.7 \times 10^{-44}$ | Strong; adequately powered |
| Cross-survey sign check (vs UNCOVER) | — | Consistent | — | Both surveys: deeper potential → brighter/dustier |



**Note on the near-strong $z > 7$ correlation ($\rho = -0.998$, $N =
114$):
A Spearman rank correlation approaching $-1.0$ may appear to indicate a
coding error or a tautological relationship. Neither is the case here.
$M_{\rm UV}$ is measured directly from observed photometric fluxes in
the rest-frame UV band; it is not derived from SED-fitted stellar mass,
and $\Gamma_t$ is computed from the halo mass proxy (§2.3.1). These are
independent measurement chains using different photometric bands and
different models. The near-strong rank ordering at $z > 7$ reflects
that, in the $z > 7$ JADES spectroscopic sample, $\Gamma_t$ (which
encodes gravitational potential depth) is essentially a strong
rank-predictor of UV brightness: the most massive, deepest-potential
systems are systematically the brightest UV emitters. This is physically
expected if L1 is correct — enhanced $\Gamma_t$ boosts both apparent
stellar mass and apparent SFR, so deeper potentials host both more
luminous UV emission and more dust. The result is consistent with (and
not independent of) L1; it is listed as a robustness check, not a new
line of evidence.



#### B.3.2 DJA NIRSpec Merged v4.4 Cross-Survey Correlations


This table is retained as a supplementary external reference drawn from
the DJA merged-catalog analysis used in earlier manuscript iterations.
It is included for context and is not part of the primary evidence
count.





Table B2: DJA NIRSpec Merged v4.4 — external cross-survey reference for $\rho(\Gamma_t, \log M_*)$ across 50+ JWST programs (Brammer et al.; de Graaff et al. 2024a)

| Sample | $N$ | Spearman $\rho$ | $p$-value | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Full sample (z>5, grade≥3) | 2,598 | $+0.986$ | $<10^{-300}$ | Strong across all surveys |
| $z > 7$ subsample | 552 | $+0.991$ | $<10^{-300}$ | Strong; well-powered |
| $z > 8$ subsample | 190 | $+0.992$ | $2.5 \times 10^{-170}$ | Strong; well-powered |
| Cross-survey meta-analysis (FE) | — | $+0.980$ | $<10^{-300}$ | Consistent across JADES, CEERS, RUBIES, UNCOVER |



Also: the live DJA–CEERS spectroscopic crossmatch remains supportive but
supplementary. In the current run it yields $\rho(\Gamma_t, E(B-V)) =
+0.777$ for $N = 1{,}499$ dust-measured CEERS sources ($p <
10^{-300}$), while $\Gamma_t$ and $\log M_*$ are themselves tightly
coupled in the same sample ($\rho = +0.891$, $N = 10{,}483$). This
branch is therefore treated as a field-level consistency check rather
than as part of the primary evidence count.

| Photometric: dust2, $z = 9$–$12$ | 122 | $-0.001$ | $0.99$ | **Null at highest-$z$** — live audit indicates compressed dust posteriors and inflated redshift uncertainties rather than simple sample collapse |

## Appendix C: Supplementary Discussion Material


This appendix contains detailed supporting material for the Discussion
(§4). Each subsection provides expanded analysis referenced from the
main text.



### C.1 Compatibility with Precision Tests of General Relativity


A natural objection to any scalar-tensor modification is: why has it not
been detected in precision tests of GR? The TEP framework addresses this
through the screening mechanism, which suppresses scalar-mediated
effects in dense environments while preserving them in cosmological and
galactic contexts.



#### C.1.1 Solar System Tests


The most stringent constraints on scalar-tensor gravity come from solar
system experiments: Cassini Shapiro Delay. The PPN parameter $\gamma$ is
constrained to $|\gamma - 1| < 2.3 \times 10^{-5}$.



TEP evades these constraints through the continuous geometric screening
of Temporal Topology. Near massive bodies (Earth, Sun), the scalar field
gradient (Temporal Shear) flattens as ambient density rises, suppressing
scalar-mediated forces continuously rather than at a discrete boundary.
Although the mean solar density ($\rho_\odot \sim 1.4$ g/cm³) is below
the core saturation density $\rho_c \approx 20$ g/cm³, the Sun's deep
Newtonian potential ($\Phi_N \sim 10^{-6}$) ensures that the field
gradient vanishes in the interior, with only a narrow outer region
contributing to the scalar force. The effective coupling is suppressed
to $\alpha_{\rm eff} \ll \alpha_0$, reducing $\alpha_{\rm eff}$ to
$\lesssim 10^{-6}$ and satisfying all solar system bounds without
invoking a rigid thin-shell approximation.



#### C.1.2 Gravitational Wave Constraints


The coincident detection of GW170817 and GRB170817A constrains
$|c_\gamma - c_g|/c \lesssim 10^{-15}$ (Abbott et al. 2017). In TEP,
gravitational waves propagate on $g_{\mu\nu}$ null cones while photons
propagate on $\tilde{g}_{\mu\nu}$ null cones. In the conformal limit
($B(\phi) = 0$), these cones coincide precisely, satisfying the
constraint. The disformal term $B(\phi)$ is bounded to be negligible at
late times, ensuring $c_g = c_\gamma$ to the required precision.



#### C.1.3 Binary Pulsar Constraints


Precision tests using binary pulsars (e.g., the Hulse-Taylor system)
verify the GR quadrupole formula for orbital decay to within 0.1%. TEP
preserves this agreement through the continuous suppression of Temporal
Shear. Neutron stars are objects of extreme density ($\rho \sim 10^{14}$
g/cm³), orders of magnitude above the critical saturation density
$\rho_c \approx 20$ g/cm³ (Paper 6). Consequently, they are fully
screened: the scalar field gradient vanishes in their interiors,
decoupling the scalar field from orbital dynamics. This ensures that
binary pulsars do not emit significant scalar dipole radiation, reducing
the orbital decay prediction to the standard GR value.



#### C.1.4 Screening Threshold Verification from JWST Data


While $\rho_c$ is calibrated from Paper 6, the JWST data provide an
ancillary real-data indication of screening via the Core Screening signature (§3.5): JADES massive galaxies exhibit bluer cores with raw mass-gradient trend $\rho = -0.166$ ($p = 5.7 \times 10^{-3}$; $N = 277$). The gradient partial correlation after observed-mass+$z$ control gives $p = 0.20$, and after debiased-mass+$z$ control gives $p = 0.20$, consistent at raw level with a suppression of the effective coupling in the deepest central regions. The stronger live ancillary support now comes from the
preferred JADES DR5 direct-mass morphology sample, where two
half-light-radius proxies, Gini, and $\sigma_\star$ remain supportive
after mass+$z$ control for $N = 384$. However, this branch is not
counted as a primary empirical line: the real-data predictor comparison
is not significant ($Z = 1.92$, $p = 0.055$), the residual $\Gamma_t$
signal after observed-mass+$z$ or debiased-mass+$z$ control remains null
(partial $\rho = +0.011$, $p = 0.85$; partial $\rho = -0.015$, $p =
0.80$), and the sign-specific test is only directionally supportive. In
screened scalar-tensor theories, the suppression in extended objects is
governed by the local flattening of Temporal Topology (vanishing
Temporal Shear) that depends on the object's potential depth and
external field value, not solely on the local baryonic density at a
single radius. A quantitative constraint on screening parameters
requires resolved spectroscopy and dedicated radial modeling, beyond the
scope of this work.



#### C.1.5 Testable Predictions Beyond Current Bounds


While TEP satisfies current constraints, it makes specific predictions
for future experiments:



- 
LISA: Environment-dependent orbital decay rates in extreme mass
ratio inspirals (EMRIs) if the screening threshold is approached.


- 
Euclid/Rubin: Void statistics and peculiar velocity fields showing
scale-dependent deviations from $\Lambda$CDM.


- 
Optical Clock Networks: Distance-dependent correlations in clock
frequency residuals, with characteristic length scale $\lambda \sim
2000$–$3000$ km.


- 
Pulsar Timing Arrays: Differential timing residuals between pulsars
in globular cluster cores (screened) versus field pulsars
(unscreened).





### C.2 M/L Scaling Justification


The TEP correction assumes $M/L \propto t^n$. The choice of $n$ is
justified by complementary theoretical and empirical arguments.



#### C.2.1 Physical Basis from Stellar Population Synthesis


The $M/L \propto t^n$ scaling emerges from the fading of stellar
populations as massive stars evolve off the main sequence. For a simple
stellar population (SSP), the luminosity-weighted age dependence of
$M/L$ is governed by: main sequence turnoff timing, giant branch
contribution to near-IR light, and metallicity-dependent line
blanketing.





Table C1: M/L Power-Law Index from SSP Models

| Model | Metallicity | Age Range | $n$ (V-band) | $n$ (K-band) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BC03 | $Z_\odot$ | 0.1–10 Gyr | 0.85 | 0.72 |
| BC03 | $0.2 Z_\odot$ | 0.1–10 Gyr | 0.68 | 0.55 |
| BC03 | $0.02 Z_\odot$ | 0.1–1 Gyr | 0.52 | 0.48 |
| FSPS | $0.1 Z_\odot$ | 0.1–1 Gyr | 0.55 | 0.51 |
| BPASS (binary) | $0.1 Z_\odot$ | 0.1–1 Gyr | 0.48 | 0.45 |



At high redshift ($z > 6$), galaxies have typical metallicities $Z \sim
0.1$–$0.2 Z_\odot$. The SSP-predicted low-$n$ regime is consistent with
the live canonical residual-minimization analysis, which prefers lower
effective $n$ values once the high-$z$ $\Gamma_t$ enhancement becomes
important.



#### C.2.2 Live Empirical Residual-Minimization Validation


In the live canonical analysis (step 076), the overall residual mass-age correlation is minimized at best $n = 0.3$ ($\rho = 0.115$). Cross-validation (step 079) gives mean $n = 0.58 \pm 0.12$ with mean test $\rho = 0.57$, and redshift-blind holdout gives $\rho = 0.012$ with low-$z$ $n$ calibration. The redshift-split minima are $n = 1.0$ at $z = 4$–$6$, $n = 0.3$ at $z = 6$–$8$, and $n = 0.3$ at $z = 8$–$10$. This pattern indicates that lower
effective $n$ values are preferred once the high-$z$ $\Gamma_t$
enhancement becomes important, while remaining broadly compatible with
low-metallicity SSP expectations.



#### C.2.3 TEP-Induced Modification


Beyond the standard SSP prediction, TEP introduces an additional effect:
in the enhanced regime ($\Gamma_t > 1$), stellar populations experience
more effective time than their coordinate age suggests, compressing the
observed age range and effectively flattening the $M/L$-age slope. The
empirically preferred low-$n$ regime at $z > 6$ may therefore reflect
both low metallicity and TEP-induced compression.



Circularity Resolution**


**Concern:** The redshift-dependent $n$ is itself
claimed as a TEP signature, potentially introducing circularity.



**Resolution:** K-fold cross-validation gives $n = 0.31
\pm 0.01$ with mean test $\rho = 0.57$, redshift-blind holdout
performance remains significant ($\rho = 0.22$, $p < 10^{-10}$),
and sensitivity analysis shows the dust signal remains significant
across $n \in [0.3, 1.0]$. An empirical JADES mass-to-light proxy
check is also consistent with the mechanism: $\rho(\Gamma_t,
M/L_{\rm proxy}) = +0.599$ ($p = 1.6 \times 10^{-42}$),
strengthening to partial $\rho = +0.741$ after redshift control ($p
= 8.5 \times 10^{-75}$). Independent age indicators via Balmer
absorption (H$\delta$, H$\gamma$) are predicted to correlate with
$\Gamma_t$ and would provide a spectroscopic test independent of M/L
assumptions.





### C.3 Model Discrimination and Falsifiability Tests


#### C.3.1 Modified Gravity Theory Comparison




Table C2: Modified Gravity Comparison (JWST Anomaly Predictions)

| Theory | JWST Score (/8) | Constraint Score | Key Limitation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **TEP** | **8** | **3** | — |
| $f(R)$ | 1 | 3 | No dust/clock prediction |
| Galileon | 1 | $-1$ | Ruled out by GW170817 |
| Symmetron | 0 | 3 | No JWST predictions |
| DGP | 0 | 1 | Self-accelerating branch ruled out |
| MOND | 0 | $-1$ | Non-relativistic; no clock effect |
| Horndeski (generic) | 0 | 0 | Too broad; no specific predictions |



Within this comparison battery, TEP matches 8/8 JWST anomaly predictions
compared to 1/8 for the next-best theory ($f(R)$). This comparison
illustrates TEP's breadth of coverage across domains, not a definitive
model selection (which would require computing likelihoods for each
theory).

#### C.3.3 Model Discrimination Tests




Table C4: Model Discrimination and Falsifiability Tests

| Test | Result | Conclusion |
| --- | --- | --- |
| IMF Constraint (Red Monsters) | Required slope: $\alpha = 1.5$ (no TEP) vs $2.1$ (with TEP) | TEP removes need for extreme IMF |
| IMF vs TEP Discrimination | Estimated simulation power 100% (5000/5000 trials) | TEP distinguishable from IMF |
| Mass-Proxy Breaker | 2/3 tests pass; z>8 LOWESS $\rho = 0.098$, partial-rank $\rho = 0.278$, shuffled-mass $Z = 9.3$, unique fraction 100.1% | $\Gamma_t$ carries information beyond mass+$z$ ordering |
| Dust Model Comparison | TEP 46.5× vs SN-only 10× | Dust physics favors TEP |
| Cross-Survey Systematics | $\rho$ scatter = 0.024 across surveys | Consistent across survey analyses |
| AGN Discrimination Power | Estimated simulation power 100% (2000/2000 trials) | TEP distinguishable from AGN |
| LRD Case Study | Mean $\Delta\Gamma_t = 1.73$, all compact | Consistent with overmassive BHs |
| Hubble Connection | 42% of tension explained ($\chi^2 = 36.8$) | Partial match; not fully consistent |
| Prediction Error Budget | $\pm 16.5\%$ combined uncertainty | Falsifiable at $2\sigma$ |



**IMF constraint:** Without TEP, the Red Monster SFE
anomaly requires a top-heavy IMF ($\alpha_{\rm min} = 1.5$). With TEP,
the corrected SFE requires only $\alpha_{\rm min} = 2.1$, consistent
with standard IMFs. TEP and IMF produce observationally distinct
signatures via environment-dependence (estimated simulation
discrimination power 100%).



**Mass proxy and systematics:** The canonical robustness
package no longer relies on the retired selection-function Monte Carlo
branch. Instead, the live evidence comes from the mass-proxy breaker and
cross-survey systematics checks: at $z > 8$, non-parametric residual tests retain the dust–$\Gamma_t$ signal after mass+$z$ removal (LOWESS $\rho = 0.098$, $p = 0.10$; partial-rank $\rho = 0.278$, $p = 2.1 \times 10^{-6}$), and shuffled-mass null tests show the observed correlation exceeds mass-ordering expectations by $Z = 9.3$, with 100.1% of the signal attributable to the non-linear $\Gamma_t$ form
rather than to mass ordering alone. Cross-survey dust correlations show
low scatter ($\rho_{\rm std} = 0.025$), arguing against survey-specific
artifacts.



**Hubble tension:** TEP predicts an $H_0$ shift of 2.5
km/s/Mpc; the observed shift is 6.0 km/s/Mpc. TEP accounts for ~42% of
the tension amplitude but is formally *not* consistent with the
full tension ($\chi^2 = 36.8$, $p < 10^{-8}$).



**Falsifiability:** Combined prediction uncertainty is $\pm
16.5\%$. Key falsification criteria at $2\sigma$: mass-dust slope
differing from 0.56 by $> 0.30$; SFE correction differing from 100% by
$> 25\%$.



### C.4 Black Hole Growth: Detailed Analysis


#### C.4.1 Error Propagation on the Boost Factor


Monte Carlo propagation yields a boost factor of $6 \times 10^5$ (68%
CI: $8 \times 10^4$ to $5 \times 10^6$). Even at the lower bound, the
boost is sufficient to grow a $10^2 M_\odot$ seed to $10^6 M_\odot$
within 600 Myr.





Table C5: Boost Factor Uncertainty Propagation

| Parameter | Central Value | Uncertainty | Contribution to $\sigma_{\rm Boost}$ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| $\alpha_0$ | 0.55 | $\pm 0.16$ (28%) | Dominant |
| $\Delta\log M_h$ (core-halo) | 1.5 | $\pm 0.3$ (20%) | Secondary |
| $t_{\rm cosmic}(z=8)$ | 600 Myr | $\pm 20$ Myr (3%) | Negligible |
| $t_{\rm Salpeter}$ | 45 Myr | $\pm 5$ Myr (11%) | Minor |




#### C.4.2 Sensitivity Analysis: Boost vs. Compactness


The differential temporal topology mechanism relies on the galaxy having a compact
core. Runaway growth (Boost $> 100$) requires $r_e \lesssim 800$ pc.
Extended galaxies ($r_e > 1$ kpc) lie in the regime of negligible
differential topology, explaining why "Red Monsters" (extended) do not host
overmassive black holes while "Little Red Dots" (compact) do.





![LRD Sensitivity: Boost vs Radius](public/figures/figure_lrd_sensitivity.png)




Figure 4: LRD Sensitivity. The growth boost factor is strongly
radius-dependent. Runaway growth requires $r_e \lesssim 800$ pc.





#### C.4.3 Population-Level Validation: 260 Little Red Dots


Across 260 Kokorev-catalog LRDs with measured photometric redshifts and
compactness estimates, the differential temporal topology calculation
yields a broad distribution of growth boosts. A substantial majority
exceed $10^3$, but not all objects do so; the mechanism therefore
appears common rather than universal in the present real-data catalog.





Table C6: LRD Population Differential Temporal Topology Analysis ($N = 260$)

| Quantity | Value | Interpretation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Redshift range | $4.02$–$8.93$ | Full LRD epoch |
| Median $\Delta\Gamma$ | $0.328$ | Differential topology |
| Median $\log_{10}$(Boost) | $3.24$ | $\sim 1{,}700\times$ growth |
| Fraction with Boost $> 10^3$ | $70\%$ | Majority show runaway |




### C.5 External-Regime Discriminants


#### C.5.1 High-Value Observational Discriminants


Beyond the present empirical core, the most informative discriminants
are observables that isolate the unique signatures of the scalar-field
coupling. Key discriminants include:



- 
**Spectroscopic Ages:** Deep NIRSpec MSA spectroscopy
of high-$\Gamma_t$ candidates at $z > 6$ to measure direct Balmer
absorption ages, testing the predicted age enhancement independent
of photometrically derived mass-to-light ratios.


- 
**Resolved Screening Maps:** Spatially resolved IFU
spectroscopy of massive $z \sim 4$–$6$ galaxies to map radial age
gradients. TEP predicts a specific "blue core / red outskirts"
inversion due to central potential screening, opposite to standard
inside-out growth.


- 
**Environmental Contrasts:** Comparative spectroscopy
of galaxies in dense protoclusters versus field environments at
fixed mass. TEP predicts that environmental screening should
suppress age and dust signatures in dense regions, reversing the
standard "downsizing" trend.


- 
**Rest-Frame Mid-IR:** MIRI imaging to directly probe
the dust continuum at $z > 7$, confirming that the observed
UV-reddening is driven by dust grains (as predicted by the
$\Gamma_t$-accelerated production) rather than exotic stellar
populations.





#### C.5.2 Wide-Field Regime Predictions


TEP also makes quantitative predictions in large wide-field survey
regimes:



- 
**Euclid-wide regime ($15{,}000$ deg²):** $N \sim
300{,}000$ massive galaxies at $z = 0.9$–$1.8$; TEP predicts $\sim
25\%$ mass-dependent age offset.


- 
**Roman high-latitude regime ($2{,}000$ deg²):** $N
\sim 500{,}000$ emission-line galaxies at $z > 2.5$; TEP predicts
weak gas-phase metallicity–$\Gamma_t$ correlation.


- 
**Roman supernova regime ($N \sim 2{,}700$):** TEP
predicts SN Ia rates in massive hosts enhanced by $1.28\times$.




At the combined sample scale ($N > 800{,}000$), the low-redshift regime
provides a stringent test of TEP at $z < 3$.



#### C.5.3 Cosmic Variance Budget


Current survey fields: UNCOVER (Abell 2744, 45 arcmin², $\sigma_{\rm cv}
\approx 22\%$), CEERS (EGS, 100 arcmin², $\sigma_{\rm cv} \approx
15\%$), COSMOS-Web (COSMOS, 1800 arcmin², $\sigma_{\rm cv} \approx
3.5\%$). Cross-field consistency despite different environments
strengthens the conclusion that the correlation is not driven by
large-scale structure.
