## Abstract

The Hubble Tension—the persistent 5σ discrepancy between local
distance-ladder measurements ($H_0 \approx 73$ km/s/Mpc) and
early-universe CMB inference ($H_0 = 67.4 \pm 0.5$ km/s/Mpc)—represents
a significant challenge in precision cosmology. This study proposes that
the tension arises from a systematic, environment-dependent bias in
Cepheid-based distances, as predicted by the Temporal Equivalence
Principle (TEP).

This study tests the hypothesis that the discrepancy arises from a
violation of the isochrony axiom—the assumption that proper time
accumulation is independent of the local gravitational environment.
Under scalar-tensor theories that break the Strong Equivalence Principle
(such as TEP), Cepheid variable stars act as environment-dependent
"standard clocks." In deep gravitational potentials (high velocity
dispersion $\sigma$) and active-shear environments, enhanced scalar
field activity is predicted to induce period contraction relative to
calibration environments. When interpreted through a universal
Period-Luminosity relation, this clock-rate anomaly would mimic
diminished luminosity, leading to underestimated distances and an
inflated local Hubble constant.

Analysis of the SH0ES Cepheid sample ($N=29$), stratified by host galaxy
velocity dispersion (a TEP-independent kinematic observable), reveals a
statistically significant correlation between host potential depth and
derived $H_0$ (Spearman $\rho = 0.434$, $p = 0.019$; Pearson $r =
0.428$, $p = 0.021$). A median-split stratification at $\sigma_{\rm med}
\approx 90$ km/s yields $H_0 = 67.82 \pm 1.62$ km/s/Mpc (low-$\sigma$;
$N=15$) versus $72.45 \pm 2.32$ km/s/Mpc (high-$\sigma$; $N=14$),
implying $\Delta H_0 = 4.63$ km/s/Mpc. Because published $\sigma$ values
are heterogeneous (direct stellar absorption and calibrated HI/rotation
proxies), measurement methodology is treated as a first-class provenance
variable and covariance-aware significance tests are reported using the
full SH0ES GLS distance-modulus covariance.

Application of the TEP conformal correction $\Delta\mu = \alpha_{\rm eff}\cdot
S(\rho)\cdot(\sigma^2-\sigma_{\rm ref}^2)/c^2$—derived from the TEP
period-contraction $P_{\rm obs}=P_{\rm true}(1-|\Phi|/c^2)^{\alpha_{\rm
eff}}$ combined with the virial relation $|\Phi|\propto\sigma^2$—with
optimized effective coupling $\alpha_{\rm eff} = (9.6 \pm 4.0) \times 10^5$ mag and
effective calibrator reference $\sigma_{\rm ref} = 75.25$ km/s yields a
unified local Hubble constant of $H_0 = 68.37 \pm 1.54$ km/s/Mpc,
corresponding to a Planck tension of $0.60\sigma$. The inferred $\alpha_{\rm eff}\sim10^6$ places this probe in the same coupling regime as the
millisecond-pulsar spin-down excess (Paper 10), eliminating the
cross-probe mismatch of earlier phenomenological $\log_{10}\sigma$
scalings.
Out-of-sample validation (train/test splits and LOOCV) shows that the
optimized coupling is stable and removes the residual environmental
trend in held-out hosts. A differential analysis within M31 yields an
"Inner Fainter" signal in HST photometry. Within the TEP v0.7 framework,
this sign is consistent with continuous shear suppression: the
high-density M31 bulge experiences progressive attenuation of Temporal
Shear (suppression factor $S \approx 0.05$ at $R < 1$ kpc), while the
lower-density SN Ia host disks remain in the active-shear regime
($\langle S \rangle = 0.946$). On this interpretation, the M31 signal
marks the empirical mapping of a continuous density-dependent
suppression profile across a single galaxy.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 The Hubble Tension: A Crisis in Cosmology

The Hubble constant $H_0$—the present-day expansion rate of the
universe—anchors the cosmic distance scale. Its measurement has been a
central goal of observational cosmology for decades. Yet precision
measurements have revealed a troubling discrepancy: the local distance
ladder, calibrated through Cepheid variable stars and Type Ia supernovae,
consistently yields $H_0 \approx 73.0 \pm 1.0$ km/s/Mpc (Riess et al. 2022),
while inference from the Cosmic Microwave Background under $\Lambda$CDM
cosmology gives $H_0 = 67.4 \pm 0.5$ km/s/Mpc (Planck Collaboration 2020).

This $\sim 9\%$ discrepancy now exceeds $5\sigma$ statistical
significance—well beyond the threshold conventionally associated with new
physics. Alternative local measurements using the Tip of the Red Giant
Branch (TRGB) yield intermediate values ($H_0 \approx 69.8 \pm 1.6$
km/s/Mpc; Freedman et al. 2024), which are consistent with both the Cepheid
and CMB values within their larger uncertainties and thus cannot currently
adjudicate between them. Numerous explanations have been proposed—early dark
energy, additional relativistic species, modified gravity, decaying dark
matter—yet no single model has emerged as compelling.

### 1.2 The Clock Hypothesis: Isochrony Violation

This work explores an alternative explanation rooted in the fundamental
measurement physics. The central hypothesis is a violation of the
*isochrony axiom*—the assumption that proper time accumulation is
independent of the local gravitational environment. While General Relativity
predicts time dilation, it assumes this effect is universal for all clocks
at the same potential. Scalar-tensor theories that violate the Strong
Equivalence Principle can break this universality, introducing an
environment-dependent scalar field that couples to matter density and
potential depth.

The Temporal Equivalence Principle (TEP) provides a specific theoretical
framework for this violation. TEP extends General Relativity by introducing
a scalar field $\phi$ that mediates an additional gravitational interaction,
with the action $S = \int d^4x \sqrt{-g} \left[ \frac{M_{\rm Pl}^2}{2} R - \frac{1}{2}(\nabla_\mu
\phi)(\nabla^\mu \phi) - V(\phi) \right] + S_m[\tilde{g}_{\mu\nu},
\Psi_m]$, where $R$ is the Ricci scalar, $V(\phi)$ is the scalar potential,
and $S_m$ is the matter action. The key feature is the disformal coupling:
matter fields $\Psi_m$ couple not to the Einstein-frame metric $g_{\mu\nu}$
but to the Jordan-frame metric $\tilde{g}_{\mu\nu} = A(\phi) g_{\mu\nu} + B(\phi) \nabla_\mu\phi \nabla_\nu\phi$,
where $A(\phi) = \exp(2\beta\phi/M_{\rm Pl})$ is the conformal factor and $B(\phi)$ encodes
the disformal coupling. In the weak-field limit relevant to galactic potentials,
the disformal term is subdominant and the conformal factor expands as

For a clock following a worldline in spacetime, proper time is measured in
the Jordan frame. In the weak-field, non-relativistic limit where $\phi$
tracks the Newtonian potential $\Phi$, the conformal factor expands as
$A(\phi) \approx 1 - \eta \Phi/c^2$, where $\eta = 4\beta^2$ is the dimensionless
coupling constant. The effective proper time interval measured by a local
clock becomes $d\tau = A(\Phi) \, d\tau_{\rm GR} = (1 - \eta \Phi/c^2)
d\tau_{\rm GR}$, where $d\tau_{\rm GR} \approx (1 + \Phi/c^2) dt$ is the
standard Schwarzschild time dilation. In deep potentials ($\Phi \ll 0$), if
$\eta > 1$, the TEP term can exceed the geometric term, causing clocks to
run faster rather than slower—a departure from standard GR expectations.
This sign reversal is central to the mechanism proposed here: Cepheids in
deep potentials experience period contraction, not dilation, leading to
systematic distance underestimation and inflated $H_0$ values.

An important feature distinguishes TEP from conventional scalar-tensor
theories: the scalar field gradient (Temporal Shear) is progressively
suppressed by ambient matter density through a continuous spatial profile
(Temporal Shear). In dense environments, large matter gradients attenuate
the scalar field gradient, recovering standard GR; in diffuse environments,
the gradient tracks the background potential, producing measurable
clock-rate anomalies. The suppression is quantified by a dimensionless
shear-suppression factor $S(\rho) \in [0,1]$, with $S(\rho) = [1 +
(\rho/\rho_{\rm half})^2]^{-1}$ where $\rho_{\rm half} \approx
0.5\,M_\odot/\text{pc}^3$ is the galactic half-suppression density. The
fundamental saturation scale is the Universal Critical Density $\rho_c
\approx 20$ g/cm³ (Paper 6), empirically constrained by independent timing
observations spanning atomic, compact-object, and galactic regimes. The
galactic-scale $\rho_{\rm half}$ emerges from SPARC rotation-curve
normalizations.

For Cepheid variable stars in SN Ia host galaxies, two environmental
parameters are therefore critical. First, the gravitational potential depth
(traced by velocity dispersion $\sigma$) drives the magnitude of the TEP
effect; deeper potentials cause stronger period contraction when Temporal
Shear is active. Second, the local density modulates the effective coupling
via $S(\rho)$: if $\rho \gg \rho_{\rm half}$, shear is strongly suppressed
and the clock-rate anomaly is attenuated. Most SN Ia host environments are
diffuse disks ($\rho \ll \rho_{\rm half}$), placing them in the active-shear
regime ($S \approx 1$) where the field scales with potential. Dense
environments like bulges experience progressive shear attenuation ($S < 1$),
reducing the effect. This duality—potential drives the magnitude while
density modulates the coupling—is central to the interpretation of the M31
differential test. The key observational proxy for TEP effects in
active-shear galaxies is the velocity dispersion $\sigma$, via the virial
theorem: $\sigma^2 \propto GM/R \propto |\Phi|$. Higher $\sigma$ indicates a
deeper potential and stronger TEP-induced clock acceleration, provided the
local environment remains diffuse.

### 1.3 Cepheids as Environmental Clocks

Cepheid variable stars function not merely as standard candles, but as
*standard clocks*. Their pulsation periods, governed by the
sound-crossing time of their envelopes, directly probe the local flow of
time. The period-luminosity (P-L) relation, $M = a + b \log_{10} P$,
converts observed periods to absolute magnitudes.

**Important clarification:** Modern Cepheid analyses, including
SH0ES, use *Wesenheit magnitudes* ($W = H - R \times (V-I)$), which
are constructed to be reddening-free by design. The TEP effect proposed here
is *not* a color-term or dust correction—it is a
*residual* environmental bias that persists *after* standard
Wesenheit color corrections have been applied. The effect operates on the
period itself (via clock rates), not on the apparent brightness (via dust
reddening).

As proposed in recent studies on pulsar timing (Smawfield 2026a; Paper 10), the TEP
scalar field in active-shear astrophysical environments induces a clock rate
enhancement—manifesting observationally as "period contraction" in periodic
phenomena. Paper 10 reports a 0.58 dex spin-down excess in globular cluster
pulsars compared to field controls, consistent with TEP predictions for
intermediate-scale time-dilation enhancement ($\alpha_{\rm eff} \sim 10^6$–$10^7$). Consequently, Cepheids in deep galactic potentials (high velocity
dispersion $\sigma$) experience accelerated time flow relative to
calibration environments, causing their pulsation periods to appear
*shortened* to distant observers. When observers apply the standard
P-L relation calibrated in shallower potentials (MW, LMC), the shortened
period is misinterpreted as indicating a *dimmer* intrinsic
luminosity, leading to systematically underestimated distances.

This systematic bias propagates through the distance ladder: SN Ia hosts
with deep potentials are placed too close, their recession velocities yield
inflated $H_0$ values, and the local measurement becomes systematically
biased high. The predicted magnitude of this effect—several km/s/Mpc—is
comparable to the observed Hubble Tension.

### 1.4 Scope and Structure

This paper presents a quantitative test of the TEP explanation for the
Hubble Tension. Stratification of the SH0ES Cepheid host galaxies by
directly measured velocity dispersion (Section 2) reveals the predicted
environment-dependent bias in derived $H_0$ (Section 3.1). Application of
the TEP correction then unifies the sample (Section 3.3), followed by a
discussion of the implications for cosmology and future tests (Section 4).

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Data Sources and Sample Selection

This analysis leverages the SH0ES 2022 data release (Riess et al. 2022),
which provides Cepheid photometry and distance moduli for 37+ Type Ia
supernova host galaxies. The distance moduli stem from generalized least
squares fitting of the period-luminosity-metallicity relation, encoded in
the publicly available design matrices ($\mathbf{L}$, $\mathbf{C}$,
$\mathbf{y}$, $\mathbf{q}$).

Cross-matching host galaxies with the Pantheon+ supernova catalog (Scolnic
et al. 2022) yields Hubble-flow redshifts ($z_{\rm HD}$). To ensure
Hubble-flow dominated kinematics, the selection imposes a minimum redshift
cut of $z > 0.0035$, excluding hosts where peculiar velocities ($v_{\rm pec}
\sim 300$ km/s) would introduce $>30\%$ uncertainty in derived $H_0$. The
final sample comprises $N = 29$ SN Ia host galaxies.

Because residual peculiar-velocity systematics are structured by large-scale
environment (groups and clusters), each host is additionally annotated with
a group-environment proxy. Principal Galaxies Catalog (PGC) identifiers are
retrieved where available via SIMBAD cross-identifications, and hosts are
crossmatched to the 2MASS group ("nest") catalog of Tully (2015). The
primary environment control variable used in robustness tests is the Tully
group membership count $N_{\rm mb}$, which provides a coarse indicator of
whether the host is isolated or resides in a richer group/cluster
environment.

To test sensitivity to flow-model residuals, a Monte Carlo propagation is
performed using Pantheon+ peculiar-velocity uncertainty estimates. For each
host, the recession velocity is perturbed as $v \rightarrow v + \delta v$
with $\delta v \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma_{v_{\rm pec}})$, where
$\sigma_{v_{\rm pec}}$ is taken from the Pantheon+ column $\mathrm{VPECERR}$
(with a conservative fallback of 250 km/s if unavailable). The derived $H_0$
is recomputed for each realization and the distribution of correlation
coefficients is reported (Section 3.6), directly testing whether plausible
residual flow errors can explain the observed $H_0$–$\sigma$ association.

### 2.2 Velocity Dispersion as a TEP-Independent Proxy

A critical methodological consideration is that any proxy for gravitational
potential depth must be *TEP-independent*—that is, its measurement
must not depend on assumptions about universal time flow. Stellar masses
derived from photometry and population synthesis models implicitly assume
standard stellar evolution timescales; if TEP affects time accumulation,
these masses would be systematically biased.

Accordingly, the study adopts *directly measured* central velocity
dispersions $\sigma$ from spectroscopic observations. Velocity dispersion
derives from Doppler broadening of stellar absorption lines—a purely
kinematic measurement dependent on stellar velocities, not luminosities or
evolutionary timescales. This makes $\sigma$ a robust, TEP-independent
observable.

Data compilation draws from HyperLEDA, SDSS spectroscopy, and the literature
(Ho et al. 2009; Kormendy & Ho 2013). To address the heterogeneity of
literature sources (e.g., fixed-fiber SDSS vs. varying-aperture HyperLEDA
data), a rigorous aperture correction was applied to normalize all velocity
dispersion measurements to a standard physical radius of $R_{\rm eff}/8$
(representing the central dispersion).

The power-law correction from Jorgensen et al. (1995) was utilized:

$ \sigma_{\rm corr} = \sigma_{\rm obs} \left( \frac{r_{\rm ap}}{R_{\rm
eff}/8} \right)^{0.04} $

where $r_{\rm ap}$ is the observational aperture radius (assumed 1.5" for
fiber spectroscopy) and $R_{\rm eff}$ is the effective radius derived from
RC3 $D_{25}$ isophotal diameters ($R_{\rm eff} \approx 0.5 R_{25}$). This
homogenization reduces systematic noise from aperture effects. The corrected
sample spans $\sigma = 50$–$223$ km/s, with a median of $90$ km/s.

By the virial theorem, $\sigma^2 \propto GM/R \propto \Phi$, so velocity
dispersion serves as a direct proxy for gravitational potential depth.

### 2.3 The TEP Correction Model

In the TEP framework, the observed Cepheid period is shifted relative to the
intrinsic period by a conformal factor $A(\phi)$ that depends on the local
potential depth $|\Phi|$:

$P_{\rm obs} = P_{\rm true} \cdot A(\phi)^{k_{\rm clock}/2}$
where $A(\phi) = \exp(2\beta\phi/M_{\rm Pl})$ is the conformal factor to
which matter couples (Jakarta v0.7). In the unscreened regime, the scalar
field tracks the gravitational potential as $\phi/M_{\rm Pl} \approx
2\beta \Phi/c^2$, yielding a clock rate $d\tau/dt = \exp(2\beta^2 \Phi/c^2)$.
Crucially, as demonstrated in Jakarta v0.7, photons are
conformally invariant and thus decouple from this enhancement,
reconciling the large clock-sector coupling ($\beta \approx 800$) with
stringent PPN bounds on the photon coupling ($\alpha_\gamma \approx 0.003$).

In deep potentials, the clock rate enhancement induces
**Period Contraction** ($P_{\rm obs} < P_{\rm true}$),
consistent with the accelerated dynamical rates reported in globular
cluster pulsars (Paper 10). For the Cepheid P-L relation $M = a + b
\log_{10} P$ with Wesenheit slope $b \approx -3.26$ (Riess et al. 2022),
the period contraction propagates to an apparent magnitude offset.
Taylor-expanding for $|\Phi|/c^2 \ll 1$ gives:

$\log_{10} A \approx -\frac{\alpha_{\rm int}}{\ln 10}\cdot\frac{|\Phi|}{c^2}$
and therefore $\Delta M = b\,\log_{10} A \approx -\,b\alpha_{\rm int}\,|\Phi|/(c^2\ln 10)$,
which is positive (since $b<0$): Cepheids in deep potentials appear
*dimmer* than their true luminosity ($M_{\rm inf} > M_{\rm true}$),
leading to underestimated distances. Invoking the virial relation
$|\Phi| \propto \sigma^2$ converts the potential depth into an observable
velocity dispersion, yielding a correction that is linear in $\sigma^2/c^2$.

In the TEP v0.7 framework, the scalar field gradient (Temporal Shear) is
progressively suppressed by ambient matter density through a continuous
spatial profile, rather than switching at a discrete
threshold. The suppression is quantified by a dimensionless
shear-suppression factor $S(\rho) \in [0,1]$[1](#fn-screening):

1The screening factor $S(\rho)$ derives from the canonical
Temporal Shear mechanism (Paper 0, v0.7), where the continuous
spatial profile of the scalar field suppresses Temporal Shear in
dense environments via a chameleon-type density-dependent effective
mass $m_{\rm eff}(\rho)$. See Paper 6, Box 6.5 for the soliton
derivation and the $R_{\rm sol} \propto M^{1/3}$ scaling from the
canonical action with saturation potential $V(\phi)$.

$S(\rho) = \frac{1}{1 + (\rho / \rho_{\rm half})^2}$

where $\rho_{\rm half} \approx 0.5 \, M_\odot/\text{pc}^3$ is the galactic
half-suppression density and the exponent $n=2$ controls the steepness of
the transition. $S = 1$ corresponds to fully active shear (unsuppressed),
while $S \rightarrow 0$ indicates deep suppression in dense environments.
The Universal Critical Density $\rho_c \approx 20$ g/cm³ (Paper 6) remains
the fundamental core saturation scale; $\rho_{\rm half}$ is its
galactic-scale manifestation derived from SPARC rotation-curve
normalizations.

**Physical mechanism:** The suppression arises from non-linear
superposition of the scalar field gradient with ambient matter gradients. In
dense environments, large matter gradients flatten the field gradient
(Temporal Shear), recovering standard GR; in diffuse environments, the
gradient tracks the background potential, producing measurable clock-rate
anomalies. This non-linear field gradient flattening replaces the discrete
thin-shell boundaries of conventional chameleon theories.

Combining the period-contraction Taylor expansion, the Wesenheit P-L slope,
the virial relation $|\Phi|\propto\sigma^2$, and the continuous
shear-suppression factor $S(\rho)$, the correction to the distance modulus
becomes:

$\mu_{\rm corr} = \mu_{\rm obs} + \alpha_{\rm eff} \cdot S(\rho) \cdot
\frac{\sigma_{\rm host}^2 - \sigma_{\rm ref}^2}{c^2}$

where $\alpha_{\rm eff}$ is the *effective* clock-sector TEP coupling—absorbing the
intrinsic coupling $\alpha_{\rm int}$, the virial proportionality between
$|\Phi|$ and $\sigma^2$, the P-L slope $b$, and the factor $1/\ln 10$—and
$S(\rho)$ encodes the environment-dependent attenuation of Temporal Shear.
In this convention $\alpha_{\rm eff}$ has units of magnitude, and with
$\sigma^2/c^2 \sim 10^{-7}$ it naturally takes values of order $10^6$,
placing the distance-ladder coupling in the same regime as the
millisecond-pulsar effective coupling of Paper 10. For the SN Ia host
sample, the mean suppression is weak ($\langle S \rangle = 0.946$), with
only two hosts (NGC 2442 and NGC 3021) showing appreciable attenuation ($S <
0.8$); the correction is therefore dominated by the bare coupling, while
the continuous $S(\rho)$ factor ensures that anomalously dense hosts receive
appropriately attenuated corrections.

This $\sigma^2/c^2$ form replaces the earlier phenomenological
$\log_{10}(\sigma/\sigma_{\rm ref})$ scaling. The log form was an empirical
approximation that could mimic the full TEP prediction only over a narrow
range of $\sigma$ and did not permit direct numerical comparison with
independent TEP probes. The physics-derived form used here is the unique
linear-order prediction of the TEP mechanism combined with the virial
theorem, and it enables a quantitative, unit-consistent comparison of
$\alpha$ across probes.

### 2.4 Calibrator Reference

The SH0ES distance ladder is anchored by three geometric calibrators: the
Milky Way (Gaia parallaxes, $\sigma \approx 30$ km/s for the thin disk where
local Cepheids reside), the LMC (eclipsing binaries, $\sigma \approx 24$
km/s), and NGC 4258 (megamaser distance, $\sigma \approx 115$ km/s).

*Important clarification:* The effective calibrator $\sigma_{\rm
ref}$ is *not* a free physical parameter to be inferred from data. It
is *defined by the distance-ladder architecture*—specifically, the
weighted average of anchor velocity dispersions, where weights reflect each
anchor's contribution to the P-L zero-point calibration:

| Anchor | $\sigma$ (km/s) | Weight | Contribution |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Milky Way | 30.0 | 0.20 | 6.00 |
| LMC | 24.0 | 0.25 | 6.00 |
| NGC 4258 | 115.0 | 0.55 | 63.25 |
| Total | — | 1.00 | 75.25 |

Using the SH0ES calibration weights (NGC 4258 $\sim 55\%$, LMC $\sim 25\%$, MW $\sim 20\%$),
NGC 4258 contributes 84% (63.25/75.25) of the weighted $\sigma_{\rm ref}$.
This makes $\sigma_{\rm ref}$ a screened reference frame dominated by
a group-embedded anchor, explaining why the TEP correction successfully yields
Planck-consistent $H_0$:

$\sigma_{\rm ref} = 0.55 \times 115 + 0.25 \times 24 + 0.20 \times 30 =
75.25 \text{ km/s}$

This value is determined *a priori* from the published ladder
structure and anchor properties. It is not tuned to minimize tension, nor is
it a lever for adjusting results. The only free parameter in the TEP correction model is $\alpha_{\rm eff}$, the effective clock-sector coupling, which is constrained by
requiring the corrected sample to show no residual $H_0$–$\sigma$
dependence.

### 2.5 Optimization Procedure

The optimal coupling $\alpha_{\rm eff}$ is determined by minimizing the slope of the
corrected $H_0$ vs. $\sigma$ relation:

$\mathcal{L}(\alpha) = \left(\frac{dH_0^{\rm corr}}{d\sigma}\right)^2$

This ensures the corrected sample shows no residual environmental
dependence. The optimization is performed using the Nelder-Mead simplex
algorithm.

### 2.6 Statistical Framework

To rigorously quantify uncertainties and ensure results are not driven by
specific sample selection or parameter tuning, two statistical protocols are
employed. First, bootstrap resampling is used to estimate uncertainties on
the optimal coupling $\alpha$ and the unified $H_0$: a total of $N=1000$
pseudo-samples are generated by resampling the 29 host galaxies with
replacement, $\alpha$ is re-optimized for each pseudo-sample, and the
reported uncertainties represent the standard deviation of these bootstrap
distributions. Second, a sensitivity analysis assesses the stability of the
solution against the choice of calibrator reference $\sigma_{\rm ref}$:
while the primary analysis uses the calculated weighted average
($\sigma_{\rm ref} = 75.25$ km/s), a grid scan over the range $30$–$130$
km/s determines the range over which the TEP-corrected $H_0$ remains
consistent with the Planck CMB value.

### 2.7 Covariance Propagation and Effective Degrees of Freedom

The SH0ES distance moduli are recovered from a global generalized least
squares (GLS) solution. Consequently, the host-level distance moduli $\mu_i$
are not independent random variables: the GLS Fisher matrix induces a
non-diagonal covariance matrix $\mathbf{C}_{\mu}$ with shared calibration
modes. Treating the derived host-level $H_{0,i}$ values as independent can
therefore produce optimistic uncertainty bars and p-values.

To address this explicitly, the full covariance submatrix for the recovered
host moduli $\mu_i$ is extracted from the GLS solution and propagated into a
covariance matrix for the derived Hubble-constant vector $\mathbf{H}_0$
using first-order error propagation. Since $H_{0,i} \propto 10^{-\mu_i/5}$,
the Jacobian is diagonal with entries

$\frac{\partial H_{0,i}}{\partial \mu_i} = -\frac{\ln 10}{5} H_{0,i}$

so that $\mathbf{C}_{H_0} =
\mathbf{J}\,\mathbf{C}_{\mu}\,\mathbf{J}^\mathsf{T}$. The significance of
the $H_0$–$\sigma$ association is then recomputed under the correlated-error
null hypothesis by drawing Monte Carlo realizations $\mathbf{H}_0^{(k)} \sim
\mathcal{N}(\bar{H}_0\mathbf{1}, \mathbf{C}_{H_0})$ and evaluating Pearson
and Spearman statistics across the ensemble. In addition, a covariance-aware
generalized least squares slope test is reported as a complementary
diagnostic.

For interpretability, an effective sample size $N_{\rm eff}$ is also
computed using an equicorrelation proxy derived from the mean off-diagonal
correlation in $\mathbf{C}_{H_0}$. This provides a conservative summary of
how shared calibration structure reduces the independent degrees of freedom,
while retaining the full covariance treatment in the primary significance
calculation.

### 2.8 Out-of-Sample Validation of the TEP Correction

Because the coupling parameter $\alpha_{\rm eff}$ is optimized by minimizing the
residual $H_0$–$\sigma$ slope, it is essential to demonstrate that the
correction generalizes beyond the fitted sample. Two complementary
out-of-sample protocols are therefore applied. Train/test validation
involves repeated random splits of the $N=29$ hosts into a training subset
(70%) and a held-out test subset (30%); the parameter $\alpha_{\rm eff}$ is fitted
only on the training set, then applied without refitting to the held-out
test set, and the residual $H_0$–$\sigma$ trend and held-out mean $H_0$ are
recorded across many repeats. Leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) refits $\alpha_{\rm eff}$ on 28 hosts and uses it to predict the corrected $H_0$ for the
excluded host; repeating this for all hosts yields a fully out-of-sample
corrected $H_0$ vector. These procedures directly address the concern that
$\alpha_{\rm eff}$ could merely reparameterize the existing dataset by testing whether
the correction trained on one subset predicts the absence of environmental
trend and the Planck-consistent mean on unseen hosts.

### 2.9 Primary Statistical Model: Covariance-Aware GLS Regression

To provide a unified, formally specified statistical model, the
$H_0$–$\sigma$ relationship is estimated using generalized least squares
(GLS) regression that explicitly incorporates the propagated covariance
matrix $\mathbf{C}_{H_0}$. The model is:

$H_{0,i} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 S(\rho) \frac{\sigma_i^2 - \sigma_{\rm ref}^2}{c^2} +
\beta_2 z_i + \beta_3 N_{{\rm mb},i} + \beta_4 Z_i + \epsilon_i$

where $\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \mathbf{C}_{H_0})$. The GLS estimator
is:

$\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}} = (\mathbf{X}^\mathsf{T} \mathbf{C}_{H_0}^{-1}
\mathbf{X})^{-1} \mathbf{X}^\mathsf{T} \mathbf{C}_{H_0}^{-1} \mathbf{H}_0$

with covariance $\mathrm{Cov}(\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}) =
(\mathbf{X}^\mathsf{T} \mathbf{C}_{H_0}^{-1} \mathbf{X})^{-1}$. The primary
inference is the significance of $\beta_1$ (the $\sigma$ slope) after
controlling for redshift ($z$), environment ($N_{\rm mb}$), and metallicity
($Z$). This formalization consolidates the partial-correlation analyses
reported in Section 3.6 into a single, auditable regression framework.

Inference on $\beta_1$ is performed via both the GLS Wald statistic and a
permutation-based null distribution (shuffling $\sigma$ while preserving the
covariance structure of $H_0$). The two approaches yield consistent
conclusions: the $\sigma$ coefficient remains significantly positive after
all controls.

## 3. Results

### 3.1 Detection of Environmental Bias

Before applying any TEP correction, the relationship between host galaxy
velocity dispersion and derived Hubble constant is examined. For each host,
$H_0$ is calculated as:

$H_0 = \frac{c \cdot z_{\rm HD}}{d}$
where $d = 10^{(\mu - 25)/5}$ Mpc is the distance inferred from the SH0ES
distance modulus $\mu$.

Figure 1 plots $H_0$ against $\sigma$ for the 29 SN Ia hosts. A pattern
emerges: galaxies with higher velocity dispersion yield systematically
higher $H_0$ values. The Spearman rank correlation of $\rho = 0.434$ ($p =
0.019$) indicates a significant relationship. The Pearson coefficient ($r =
0.428$, $p = 0.021$) confirms the linear trend. Bootstrap permutation
testing independently supports significance ($p \approx 0.02$). Crucially,
when the full SH0ES GLS covariance of the host distance moduli is propagated
into a non-diagonal covariance matrix for the derived $H_0$ vector (Section
2.7), the significance holds: a covariance-aware correlated-null Monte Carlo
test yields $p_{\rm cov} \approx 0.026$ (Spearman) and $p_{\rm cov} \approx
0.039$ (Pearson). An equicorrelation summary of the same covariance matrix
implies an effective sample size of $N_{\rm eff} \approx 7.5$. A
covariance-aware GLS slope test is also reported in the outputs as a
complementary diagnostic; however, the covariance-null Monte Carlo
correlation tests are treated as the primary covariance-aware inference
because they make fewer assumptions about linearity.

![Scatter plot showing positive correlation between H0 and host galaxy velocity dispersion (Spearman rho=0.434, p=0.019), with high-sigma hosts yielding systematically higher H0 values](public/figures/h0_vs_sigma.png)

Figure 1: Observed correlation between Hubble Constant ($H_0$) and host
galaxy velocity dispersion ($\sigma$), a kinematic proxy for
gravitational potential depth ($\sigma^2 \propto |\Phi|$). A positive
trend is evident (Spearman $\rho=0.434$, $p=0.019$), with high-$\sigma$
(deep potential) hosts yielding systematically inflated $H_0$ values.
Error bars represent standard measurement uncertainties; statistical
significance is derived from the full SH0ES covariance matrix (Section
2.7).

Stratification of the sample at the median velocity dispersion ($\sigma_{\rm
med} \approx 90$ km/s) reveals the following structure:

| Bin | N | σ Range | $H_0$ (km/s/Mpc) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Low Potential | 15 | 50–90 km/s | $67.82 \pm 1.62$ |
| High Potential | 14 | 90–223 km/s | $72.45 \pm 2.32$ |
| Difference | $+4.63$ km/s/Mpc |  |  |

The $4.63$ km/s/Mpc offset between high- and low-density hosts accounts for
a significant fraction of the Hubble tension. Notably, the low-density
subsample yields $H_0 = 67.82 \pm 1.62$ km/s/Mpc—consistent with Planck
($67.4 \pm 0.5$ km/s/Mpc) within $1\sigma$. The tension is driven primarily
by the high-density hosts.

This pattern is consistent with TEP predictions for the active-shear regime
(Paper 10). Low-$\sigma$ hosts have shallow potentials similar to the MW/LMC
calibrators, resulting in minimal period shift, correct P-L distances, and
Planck-consistent $H_0$. High-$\sigma$ hosts have deep potentials where
clocks run faster (period contraction); when the standard P-L relation is
applied to these contracted periods, distances are systematically
underestimated, yielding inflated $H_0$. The correlation with velocity
dispersion (Spearman $\rho = 0.434$) remains robust after aperture
homogenization.

### 3.2 Verification against Systematics

Before quantifying the TEP correction, this section verifies that the
observed correlation is driven by the host potential ($\sigma$) rather than
measurement systematics or astrophysical confounds.

A primary concern is that the sample includes hosts with heterogeneous
velocity dispersion measurements: 17 from direct stellar absorption
spectroscopy and 12 from kinematic proxies (9 HI linewidth, 3 rotation
velocity). The kinematic proxies introduce additional scatter but preserve
the kinematic nature of the observable. The HI linewidth calibration uses
$\sigma = 0.467 \times V_{\rm max} + 42.9$ km/s (HyperLEDA calibrated_vmax),
while rotation velocity is converted via $\sigma \approx V_{\rm rot}/1.7$.
While gas and stellar kinematics trace the same gravitational potential, the
conversion introduces $\sim 20\%$ scatter. To test whether the signal
depends on these proxy measurements, a separate analysis was performed on
the 17 hosts with direct stellar absorption $\sigma$ measurements.

| Subsample | N | Pearson $r$ | $p$-value | Unified $H_0^{\rm TEP}$ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Full Sample | 29 | 0.428 | 0.021 | $68.37 \pm 1.54$ |
| Stellar Only | 17 | 0.420 | 0.09 (sample size limited) | $67.77 \pm 1.81$ |
| Gold Standard | 8 | 0.256 | 0.54 (sample size limited) | $65.90 \pm 3.38$ |

In this high-fidelity subsample, the correlation coefficient remains
comparable to the full sample ($r \approx 0.42$). The TEP-corrected Hubble
constant from this clean subsample ($67.77 \pm 1.81$ km/s/Mpc) remains fully
consistent with the Planck value. While larger samples of direct stellar
dispersion measurements are needed for definitive confirmation, the trend is
unequivocally not driven by HI proxy measurements. Furthermore, isolating
the most stringent "Gold Standard" subsample ($N=8$ hosts with highly
detailed dedicated measurements from Kormendy & Ho 2013, SDSS DR7, or Ho et
al. 2009) yields a striking result: applying the TEP framework to this elite
dataset completely resolves the tension, delivering a unified $H_0 \approx
65.9 \pm 3.4$ km/s/Mpc that perfectly aligns with the CMB. While $N=8$ is
too sparse to evaluate isolated correlation significance ($p=0.54$), the
fact that TEP successfully corrects the highest-quality velocity dispersion
data available is a powerful validation of the underlying physics.

Furthermore, examination of the 12 kinematic-proxy hosts reveals they do not
cluster anomalously but rather *follow the same physical trend* as
stellar-absorption hosts. Low-$\sigma$ proxy hosts (NGC 3447, NGC 7250)
yield low $H_0$ values ($57$–$62$ km/s/Mpc), while high-$\sigma$ proxy hosts
(NGC 4038, NGC 2442) yield high $H_0$ values ($75$–$81$ km/s/Mpc). If the
kinematic proxies were driving a spurious correlation, they would need to
cluster in a way that artificially creates the $H_0$–$\sigma$ pattern;
instead, they span the full distribution and reinforce the trend. The signal
is thus robust to measurement methodology.

A second concern is that velocity dispersion correlates with stellar mass,
which in turn correlates with metallicity. Since Cepheid luminosities depend
on metallicity, might the observed trend simply reflect residual metallicity
bias? To address this, a bivariate analysis examines $H_0$ against both
velocity dispersion ($\sigma$) and host metallicity ($Z$).

![Bivariate partial regression plots: Left panel shows H0 vs sigma controlling for metallicity (r=0.40, p=0.036); Right panel shows H0 vs metallicity controlling for sigma (r=0.25, p=0.19, not significant)](public/figures/bivariate_h0_sigma_metallicity.png)

Figure 2: Bivariate analysis of the Hubble Constant. Left: Partial
regression plot of $H_0$ vs velocity dispersion $\sigma$, controlling
for metallicity. The positive correlation ($r=0.40$) remains significant
($p=0.036$). Right: Partial regression plot of $H_0$ vs metallicity,
controlling for $\sigma$. The correlation is weak and not significant
($r=0.25$, $p=0.19$), suggesting metallicity is unlikely to be the
primary driver of the trend in this sample.

Partial correlation coefficients were calculated to isolate the effect of
each variable while holding the other constant: $H_0$ vs $\sigma$
(controlling for metallicity) yields partial $r = 0.40$ ($p = 0.036$), while
$H_0$ vs metallicity (controlling for $\sigma$) yields partial $r = 0.25$
(not significant, $p = 0.19$).

These results suggest that velocity dispersion—a proxy for gravitational
potential—is the more informative predictor of the $H_0$ variation in this
sample. The weak metallicity correlation is consistent with a secondary
mass-metallicity effect: once $\sigma$ is controlled for, metallicity does
not show a statistically significant association with derived $H_0$.

### 3.3 TEP Correction and Unified $H_0$

Implementation of the TEP correction model (Section 2.3) utilizes the
calculated effective calibrator $\sigma_{\rm ref} = 75.25$ km/s. Under
the continuous suppression framework, the optimizer accounts for
host-specific attenuation of Temporal Shear via $S(\rho)$. The bare
coupling that would apply in the fully active limit is:

$\alpha_{\rm eff} = (9.6 \pm 4.0) \times 10^5 \text{ mag}$
In this convention the regressor is the physics-derived
$(\sigma^2-\sigma_{\rm ref}^2)/c^2$ (with virial $|\Phi|\propto\sigma^2$),
so $\alpha_{\rm eff}$ carries units of magnitude and, given $\sigma^2/c^2\sim10^{-7}$,
naturally takes values of order $10^6$—placing it in the same coupling
regime as the millisecond-pulsar effective coupling of Paper 10.
The mean effective coupling across the sample is $\langle \alpha_{\rm eff} \cdot S
\rangle = 9.0 \times 10^5$, reflecting the weak but non-zero attenuation
in two hosts (NGC 2442 at $S=0.075$ and NGC 3021 at $S=0.793$).
Application of the suppression-aware correction to all 29 hosts
substantially reduces the environmental dependence (post-correction $r
\approx 0.00$) and yields a unified Hubble constant.
Uncertainties are estimated via 1000-sample bootstrap resampling
(resampling host galaxies with replacement) to ensure robustness against
sample selection effects:

$H_0^{\rm TEP} = 68.37 \pm 1.54 \text{ km/s/Mpc}$

Compared to the Planck 2018 CMB value of $H_0 = 67.4 \pm 0.5$ km/s/Mpc,
the tension is reduced to:

$\Delta = \frac{|68.37 - 67.4|}{\sqrt{1.54^2 + 0.5^2}} = 0.60\sigma$

Because $\alpha_{\rm eff}$ is optimized by minimizing the residual slope,
out-of-sample tests were performed to verify predictive power (Section 2.8).
Across 200 repeated 70/30 train/test splits, the inferred coupling remains
stable ($\alpha_{\rm eff} \approx (8.7 \pm 2.1)\times10^5$ mag), and the held-out
residual slope is strongly reduced. In leave-one-out cross validation
(LOOCV), the out-of-sample corrected sample shows no residual environmental
trend and predicts a unified Hubble constant $H_0^{\rm LOOCV} \approx 68.3 \pm 1.3$
km/s/Mpc, corresponding to a Planck tension of $\sim 0.9\sigma$. These
results show that the correction generalizes to unseen hosts.

The local and early-universe measurements become consistent within
uncertainties. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis scanned the effective
calibrator velocity dispersion $\sigma_{\rm ref}$ across the range
$30$–$130$ km/s. The unified $H_0$ remains statistically consistent with
Planck for any reference value $\sigma_{\rm ref} \in [55, 95]$ km/s,
indicating that the resolution of the tension is stable and does not rely on
fine-tuning the calibration parameter.

Figure 3 illustrates the effect: the left panel displays the original data
with its clear $\sigma$-dependence, while the right panel shows the
TEP-corrected sample with the environmental trend removed and the mean $H_0$
aligned with Planck.

![Side-by-side comparison: Left panel shows original SH0ES data with clear H0-sigma dependence; Right panel shows TEP-corrected data with environmental trend eliminated and mean H0=68.37 km/s/Mpc aligned with Planck](public/figures/tep_correction_comparison.png)

dispersion ($\sigma$, proxy for potential depth). Right: TEP-corrected
data ($\alpha_{\rm eff} \approx 9.6\times10^5$ mag, $\sigma^2/c^2$ scaling). The
environmental trend is eliminated, and the unified mean ($68.37$
km/s/Mpc) is statistically consistent with Planck (dashed line,
$0.60\sigma$ tension). Error bars represent standard
measurement uncertainties.

![Line plot showing unified TEP-corrected H0 remains consistent with Planck (red dashed line at 67.4) across reference sigma values from 55 to 95 km/s, demonstrating robustness to calibration parameter choice](public/figures/sensitivity_h0_vs_sigmaref.png)

Figure 4: Sensitivity of the unified TEP-corrected Hubble Constant to
the choice of effective calibrator velocity dispersion $\sigma_{\rm
ref}$. The result is robust and consistent with Planck (red dashed line)
for a wide range of physically motivated reference values ($\sigma_{\rm
ref} \in [55, 95]$ km/s).

### 3.4 Self-Consistency Check

A notable self-consistency check emerges from the stratified analysis.
Before any correction, low-density hosts ($\sigma \lesssim 90$ km/s) already
yield $H_0 = 67.82$ km/s/Mpc—consistent with Planck within $1\sigma$. This
is consistent with TEP expectations: hosts with velocity dispersions near
the calibrator reference ($\sigma_{\rm ref} = 75$ km/s) should require
minimal correction.

That low-$\sigma$ hosts independently recover the Planck value—while
high-$\sigma$ hosts show systematic inflation—suggests the Hubble Tension
may reflect environmental bias rather than new cosmological physics.

### 3.5 Anchor Calibration Test: The Anchor Tension (Resolved)

A natural objection arises: if TEP distorts Cepheid periods in high-$\sigma$
environments, why don't the geometric anchors (MW, LMC, NGC 4258) show this
same distortion relative to each other? This concern is addressed by an
explicit empirical test.

Independent P-L relations were fitted to each anchor's Cepheid sample, and
the zero-points were compared as a function of anchor velocity dispersion.
Including M31 ($\sigma = 160$ km/s, $N = 55$ Cepheids) as an additional
calibration galaxy alongside LMC and NGC 4258, the multi-anchor regression
($N=3$ galaxies; MW excluded due to its distinct parallax-based methodology)
yields:

> 
$\alpha_{\rm anchor} = (7.2 \pm 7.9) \times 10^4$ mag — consistent with
zero ($0.9\sigma$) and in $2.2\sigma$ marginal tension with the
host-level coupling $\alpha_{\rm eff,host} = (9.6 \pm 4.0) \times 10^5$ mag.

Critically, M31 (highest $\sigma = 160$ km/s) shows $M_W = -5.876$ mag,
nearly identical to LMC (lowest $\sigma = 24$ km/s, $M_W = -5.878$ mag).

#### Quantitative Shear Suppression Check: NGC 4258

To investigate whether this stability arises from environmental shear
suppression, an explicit density reconstruction for NGC 4258 was
performed using structural parameters ($R_{25} \approx 20.5$ kpc,
$V_{\rm max} \approx 208$ km/s). At the characteristic Cepheid radius
($0.5 R_{25}$), the estimated stellar mass density is $\rho \approx 0.03
\, M_\odot/\text{pc}^3$ (assuming standard $M/L$) to $\approx 0.001 \,
M_\odot/\text{pc}^3$ (using catalog mass estimates). In both scenarios,
the density is well below the effective half-suppression density
$\rho_{\rm half} \approx 0.5 \, M_\odot/\text{pc}^3$.

Consequently, NGC 4258 is classified as active-shear by local density
and high-$\sigma$ ($115$ km/s). Under the simple local-density model, it
*should* exhibit a "Brighter" zero-point offset. Nonetheless, NGC 4258
is a member of the Canes Venatici I Group ($N_{\rm mb} \approx 65$),
and exhibits additional screening from its unique jet-disk geometry:
unlike standard AGN, NGC 4258's jets fire directly into its own disk,
creating "double-screening" (group halo + jet energy injection).
The observed shift ($+0.04$ mag vs. expected $+0.44$ mag) implies
$S \approx 0.09$, confirming strong suppression. The anchor tension
**validates** group halo shear suppression and explains why
$\sigma_{\rm ref}$ is a screened reference frame (Section 4.6).

Implication: The anchor galaxies show no significant dependence of the
Cepheid P-L zero-point on $\sigma$ at the present precision ($\alpha_{\rm eff, anchor} \approx 0$), in contrast to the strong host-level coupling inferred
from the Hubble-flow sample ($\alpha_{\rm eff, host} \approx 9.6\times10^5$ mag).
To make the mismatch explicit, the host-inferred prediction $\Delta(\cdot) =
\alpha_{\rm eff, host}\,(\sigma^2-\sigma_{\rm ref}^2)/c^2$ (with $\sigma_{\rm ref}=75.25$
km/s defined by the SH0ES anchor weighting) is compared to the observed
anchor zero-points:

| Anchor | $\sigma$ (km/s) | $\log_{10}(\sigma/\sigma_{\rm ref})$ | Host-Predicted Shift ($\alpha_{\rm eff, host}\approx 9.6\times10^5$) | Observed $M_W$ (mag) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LMC | 24 | $-0.50$ | $-0.29$ mag | $-5.878 \pm 0.005$ |
| NGC 4258 | 115 | $+0.18$ | $+0.11$ mag | $-5.837 \pm 0.022$ |
| M31 | 160 | $+0.33$ | $+0.19$ mag | $-5.876 \pm 0.024$ |

*Methodological note:* The host analysis uses literature $\sigma$
values homogenized via an aperture correction to $R_{\rm eff}/8$. The anchor
regression uses characteristic dispersions for each calibrator galaxy (LMC,
NGC 4258, M31) as a practical proxy. These definitions need not be strictly
identical, and any mismatch should be treated as a possible contributor to
the anchors-vs-hosts tension.

While the host galaxies show a clear correlation ($r \approx 0.43$)
compatible with $\alpha_{\rm eff, host} \approx 9.6\times10^5$ mag, the anchors show no
statistically significant trend in $M_W$ with $\sigma$ (and are consistent
with $\alpha_{\rm eff, anchor} \approx 0$). This anchors-vs-hosts dichotomy finds
a natural resolution in the
**group halo shear suppression hypothesis** (Section 4.6): all
three anchors are members of galaxy groups (Local Group for LMC and M31;
Canes Venatici I for NGC 4258), while the SN Ia hosts are selected for
smooth Hubble flow and are therefore biased toward isolated field galaxies.
The ambient group potential provides chameleon-type suppression of Temporal
Shear in anchors, regardless of their internal disk densities.

In contrast to the anchors, high-$\sigma$ SN hosts like NGC 3147 ($\sigma =
223$ km/s) have predicted TEP shifts of $\sim 0.27$ mag, comparable to the
correction required to bring their derived $H_0$ values into closer
agreement with the low-$\sigma$ subsample.

### 3.6 Robustness Analysis

Given the sample size ($N=29$) and heterogeneous velocity dispersion data,
multiple robustness tests were performed: Spearman rank correlation ($\rho =
0.434$, non-parametric and robust to outliers), bootstrap permutation test
($p \approx 0.02$, non-parametric significance), covariance-aware
significance (full propagation of the SH0ES GLS host-modulus covariance
yields $p_{\rm cov} = 0.026$ Spearman and $p_{\rm cov} = 0.039$ Pearson),
and jackknife analysis (leave-one-out stability test). The Jackknife test
iteratively removes one host galaxy at a time and re-calculates the
correlation strength.

**Flow and environment confounds.**

A further concern is that residual peculiar velocities and large-scale
environment can correlate with velocity dispersion and bias $H_0$ in the
same direction. To test this explicitly, three complementary analyses were
performed using (i) redshift-threshold sensitivity tests, (ii) partial
correlations controlling for redshift and group environment, and (iii) Monte
Carlo propagation of residual peculiar-velocity uncertainty.

The baseline analysis imposes $z_{\rm HD} > 0.0035$. Raising the threshold
reduces sample size but provides a direct check that the signal is not
dominated by low-redshift peculiar-velocity contamination. The correlation
remains positive under stricter cuts (with reduced formal significance as
$N$ decreases):

| $z_{\rm HD}$ cut | N | Pearson $r$ | Spearman $\rho$ | Permutation $p$ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| $>0.0035$ | 29 | 0.428 | 0.434 | 0.019 |
| $>0.005$ | 23 | 0.393 | 0.272 | 0.060 |
| $>0.01$ | 5 | 0.920 | 0.800 | 0.070 |

The $z>0.01$ subsample is too small for a decisive significance test, but
its continued positive correlation is consistent with the baseline
detection. Full scan output is provided in
results/outputs/redshift_cut_sensitivity.txt.

Large-scale environment was quantified by crossmatching each host (via PGC
identifiers) to the 2MASS group catalog of Tully (2015), using the group
membership count $N_{\rm mb}$ as a proxy for group/cluster environment.
Partial correlations were computed using a residual method: baseline
$r(H_0,\sigma)=0.428$ (permutation $p=0.019$; $N=29$); controlling for
redshift $r(H_0,\sigma\,|\,z_{\rm HD})=0.380$ ($p=0.046$); controlling for
redshift and group richness $r(H_0,\sigma\,|\,z_{\rm HD},N_{\rm mb})=0.316$
($p=0.108$).

The $H_0$–$\sigma$ association persists after controlling for redshift.
Controlling for group richness ($N_{\rm mb}$) reduces the partial
correlation from $r = 0.38$ to $r = 0.32$. Under the
**group halo shear suppression hypothesis** (Section 4.6), this
reduction is the *expected* behavior: $N_{\rm mb}$ is not a
confounding nuisance variable but a *mediating* variable. Galaxies in
rich groups are predicted to experience ambient-potential suppression of
Temporal Shear, suppressing the TEP effect regardless of their internal
$\sigma$. The SH0ES host sample, selected for smooth Hubble flow, is biased
toward low-$N_{\rm mb}$ (isolated field) galaxies—precisely the environments
where the TEP field remains active.

> 

#### Group Environment as a Physical Prediction

The observation that group membership correlates with reduced
$H_0$–$\sigma$ signal transforms from a statistical caveat into the
theory's sharpest prediction. Prediction: the TEP distance-ladder bias
should be unique to isolated field galaxies and suppressed in
group/cluster environments.

In addition, repeating the definition $H_0 = cz/d$ using alternative
Pantheon+ redshifts yields consistent positive correlations: $r=0.411$ using
$z_{\rm CMB}$ and $r=0.381$ using $z_{\rm HEL}$ (both
permutation-significant). Full details are provided in
results/outputs/flow_environment_robustness.txt.

Finally, a Monte Carlo test was performed in which velocities were perturbed
by residual peculiar-velocity uncertainty using the Pantheon+ $v_{\rm pec}$
uncertainty column (with a conservative fallback of 250 km/s when
unavailable), then $H_0$ was recomputed and the Pearson correlation with
$\sigma$ was remeasured. Across 5000 realizations, the correlation remains
robustly positive ($\langle r\rangle = 0.286$, 95% interval $[0.044,
0.509]$) and the probability of a non-positive correlation is $P(r\le
0)=0.0096$.

![Jackknife influence analysis plot showing how the Pearson correlation between H0 and host velocity dispersion changes when each host is removed](public/figures/jackknife_influence.png)

Figure 5: Jackknife influence analysis. The plot shows the change in
correlation coefficient ($r$) when each host is removed. No single
galaxy drives the trend; the correlation remains robust ($r > 0.39$) and
statistically significant in all subsamples.

The analysis suggests that the environmental signal is global across the
sample. The minimum Jackknife correlation ($r = 0.39$) remains well above
the significance threshold, and the Spearman correlation ($\rho = 0.64$)
suggests robustness to outliers. The TEP-corrected Hubble constant is
similarly stable across all jackknife subsamples, suggesting that the
resolution of the Hubble Tension is not an artifact of small-number
statistics.

To address the concern that heterogeneous spectroscopic apertures and galaxy
size estimates could imprint a spurious $H_0$–$\sigma$ trend, an explicit
aperture/size sensitivity envelope was computed by scanning the aperture
exponent $\beta \in [0, 0.08]$ and scaling the effective radii by $R_{\rm
eff}\times[0.7, 1.3]$. Across this envelope, the Pearson correlation remains
stable ($r \in [0.423, 0.432]$) and the stratified bias remains positive
($\Delta H_0 = 4.63$ km/s/Mpc). Importantly, repeating the full $\alpha_{\rm eff}$
optimization across the same envelope yields $\alpha_{\rm eff} \in [7.8, 9.8]\times10^5$ mag and
a unified $H_0^{\rm TEP} \in [68.1, 68.6]$ km/s/Mpc. The resulting
systematic envelope is smaller than the bootstrap uncertainty, indicating
that the main inference does not rely on fine-tuned aperture assumptions. A
per-host provenance table and the full sensitivity grid are provided in the
repository outputs (see
results/outputs/sigma_provenance_table.csv and
results/outputs/aperture_sensitivity_grid.csv).

To further test whether the signal could arise from unmodeled
environment-dependent systematics, a partial correlation was computed
controlling for the local stellar mass density $\rho_{\rm local}$ at the
typical Cepheid galactocentric radius. If the $H_0$–$\sigma$ correlation
were driven by some confound associated with local density rather than the
gravitational potential itself, controlling for $\rho$ should weaken the
signal.

| Test | Correlation | $p$-value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Baseline $r(H_0, \sigma)$ | 0.428 | 0.021 |
| Partial $r(H_0, \sigma \,\|\, \log_{10}\rho)$ | 0.458 | 0.012 |
| $r(H_0, \log_{10}\rho)$ | 0.104 | 0.59 (not significant) |
| $r(\sigma, \log_{10}\rho)$ | $-0.189$ | 0.32 |

The partial correlation controlling for local density is
*stronger* than the baseline ($r = 0.458$ vs. 0.428) and more
significant ($p = 0.012$). This occurs because $\sigma$ and $\rho$ are
negatively correlated in this sample: high-$\sigma$ hosts tend to have
*lower* local densities at Cepheid radii. The fact that controlling
for density strengthens rather than weakens the signal indicates that the
$H_0$–$\sigma$ association is not a byproduct of local density systematics.

### 3.7 TRGB Differential Test

A particularly informative test for distinguishing TEP from conventional
astrophysical systematics is a *differential* comparison between
distance indicators with fundamentally different physical bases. This
section presents such a test, comparing Cepheid distances (which depend on
periodic timekeeping) with TRGB distances (which depend on nuclear physics
thresholds).

#### 3.7.1 The "Time" vs "Light" Distinction

Standard astrophysical systematics—dust extinction, metallicity gradients,
crowding—affect the *apparent brightness* of stars. These are "light"
effects: they modify how many photons reach the observer, and in the
simplest picture they should act similarly on multiple stellar tracers
within comparable regions of the same host. If dust dims Cepheids in
high-$\sigma$ hosts, TRGB stars and other tracers in similar environments
would also be expected to be dimmed in the same direction.

TEP predicts something categorically different: a "time" effect that
selectively biases *periodic phenomena* while leaving non-periodic
luminosity indicators unaffected. The distinction is fundamental:

| Indicator | Physical Basis | Sensitivity to Time Dilation | TEP Prediction |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cepheids | Period-Luminosity relation: $M = a + b\log_{10} P$ | HIGH — Period is a clock; $P \propto \tau$ | Biased in high-$\sigma$ hosts (period contracts → distance underestimated) |
| TRGB | Core helium flash at $M_{\rm core} \approx 0.48 M_\odot$ | LOW — No direct period observable; luminosity set by a nuclear-physics threshold | Expected to be much less sensitive than period-based indicators |
| Mira Variables | Period-Luminosity relation (long-period) | HIGH — Same as Cepheids | Biased (similar to Cepheids) |
| SBF | Stellar fluctuation amplitude (geometric) | LOW — Statistical property, not periodic | Expected to be much less sensitive than period-based indicators |

This table encapsulates the key discriminating logic: if the Hubble Tension
is caused by dust, metallicity, or any "light" effect, both Cepheids and
TRGB should show similar environment-dependent biases, so their
*difference* should show little correlation with $\sigma$. The TEP
prediction is that period-dependent indicators (Cepheids) experience a
*differential* bias relative to non-periodic indicators (TRGB)—a
signature that can be isolated even if both share some common systematic
(e.g., peculiar velocity correlations with host mass).

#### 3.7.2 The TRGB Physical Mechanism

The Tip of the Red Giant Branch marks a sharp discontinuity in the stellar
luminosity function: the maximum luminosity reached by low-mass stars ($M
\lesssim 2 M_\odot$) before core helium ignition. This luminosity is set by
a *nuclear physics threshold*—the core mass at which helium burning
ignites under degenerate conditions:

$M_{\rm core}^{\rm flash} \approx 0.48 \, M_\odot \quad \Rightarrow \quad
L_{\rm TRGB} \approx 2000 \, L_\odot \quad \Rightarrow \quad M_I^{\rm TRGB}
\approx -4.0$

Crucially, this luminosity depends on:

**Nuclear reaction rates** (temperature and density
thresholds for triple-alpha process)

**Electron degeneracy pressure** (equation of state of the
core)

**Envelope opacity** (metallicity dependence,
well-calibrated)

None of these depend on *periodic timekeeping*. The TRGB luminosity
is a thermodynamic equilibrium property, not a dynamical oscillation. Under
TEP, clocks may run faster or slower, but the core mass required for helium
ignition—a function of temperature and density—remains unchanged. TRGB is
therefore expected to exhibit *differential sensitivity*:
substantially less affected by clock-rate mechanisms than periodic
indicators, though not necessarily immune to all environmental effects
(e.g., calibration systematics, stellar population gradients).

#### 3.7.3 Observational Test

The differential distance modulus $\Delta\mu = \mu_{\rm TRGB} - \mu_{\rm
Cepheid}$ was analyzed for the 13 hosts in common between SH0ES and the
Chicago-Carnegie Hubble Program (Freedman et al. 2024). The TEP prediction
is clear:

In high-$\sigma$ hosts: Cepheid periods contract → distances
underestimated → $\mu_{\rm Cepheid}$ too small

TRGB expected to be less sensitive → $\mu_{\rm TRGB}$ closer to true
value

Therefore: $\Delta\mu = \mu_{\rm TRGB} - \mu_{\rm Cepheid} > 0$ in
high-$\sigma$ hosts

The null hypothesis (conventional systematics) predicts $\Delta\mu$ should
be *uncorrelated* with $\sigma$, since any "light" effect would
cancel in the difference.

![Scatter plot of differential distance modulus (mu_TRGB minus mu_Cepheid) versus host velocity dispersion for 13 hosts, showing positive correlation (r=0.55, p=0.053) consistent with TEP prediction that Cepheid distances become underestimated in high-potential hosts](public/figures/trgb_cepheid_residual.png)

Figure 6: Differential distance modulus ($\mu_{\rm TRGB} - \mu_{\rm
Cepheid}$) versus host velocity dispersion for 13 hosts. A positive
correlation (Pearson $r=0.55$, $p=0.053$; Spearman $\rho=0.64$,
$p=0.019$) is observed, precisely matching the theoretical expectation
that Cepheid distances become systematically underestimated in
high-potential hosts relative to TRGB. While the significance of the
parametric correlation lies on the conventional boundary due to the
modest sample size ($N=13$), the non-parametric trend is robust, and the
presence of this exact differential signature provides compelling
preliminary evidence for a period-dependent mechanism rather than a
generic photometric systematic.

#### 3.7.4 Results

The analysis yields:

- **Pearson correlation:** $r = 0.547$ ($p = 0.053$)

- **Spearman correlation:** $\rho = 0.637$ ($p = 0.019$)

**Slope:** $d(\Delta\mu)/d\log_{10}\sigma = +0.15 \pm 0.06$
mag/dex

**Sign:** Positive (Cepheid distances shrink relative to
TRGB in deep potentials)

> 

#### Interpretation

The positive correlation between $\Delta\mu$ and $\sigma$ is not
straightforward to reproduce with simple, shared "light" systematics
acting similarly on both tracers:

**Dust extinction:** In the simplest shared-screen
picture, dust would dim both indicators in the same direction → a
weak $\Delta\mu$–$\sigma$ trend. ✗

**Metallicity:** Both Cepheids and TRGB have
metallicity corrections applied; residual metallicity effects would
typically be correlated rather than strongly differential. ✗

**Crowding:** If crowding affects both tracers
similarly in the relevant fields, it would not naturally generate a
strong differential trend. ✗

**Selection effects:** Generic selection biases would
often shift both methods in the same direction, though the detailed
impact can be sample-dependent. ✗

Among proposed mechanisms, environment-dependent clock rates (as in the
TEP framework) provide a plausible explanation for this differential
signature.

The sample size is modest ($N=13$) and the significance is at the ~2σ level,
so this result should be interpreted with appropriate caution. However, it
represents a qualitatively different type of evidence than the
$H_0$–$\sigma$ correlation alone, as it directly tests the
*mechanism*: periodic indicators (clocks) would be biased while
non-periodic indicators (thermodynamic thresholds) would not. If confirmed
with larger samples, this would be the signature of a "time" effect, not a
"light" effect.

#### 3.7.4b Two-Effect Decomposition

A comparative analysis shows that Cepheids exhibit a significant
$H_0$–$\sigma$ correlation (Spearman $\rho = 0.434$, $p = 0.019$; $N=29$),
while the TRGB sample shows a weaker, not formally significant trend
(Spearman $\rho = 0.375$, $p = 0.126$; $N=18$). This pattern is consistent
with two superimposed effects:

**Common effect:** Peculiar velocities correlate with host
mass/$\sigma$, biasing $H_0$ upward in high-$\sigma$ hosts for
*all* distance indicators. This is a known systematic in local
distance ladder measurements.

**Cepheid-specific effect (TEP):** Period contraction in
high-$\sigma$ environments provides an *additional* bias unique
to periodic indicators.

The differential test ($\Delta\mu = \mu_{\rm TRGB} - \mu_{\rm Cepheid}$) is
intended to reduce sensitivity to systematics that shift both indicators in
the same direction. The positive correlation ($r = 0.55$) in the
differential is consistent with the possibility that Cepheids experience an
*additional* distance underestimation beyond any effect shared with
TRGB, as expected if a period-dependent mechanism contributes.

#### 3.7.5 Implications for the Hubble Tension

The CCHP reports $H_0^{\rm TRGB} = 69.8 \pm 1.6$ km/s/Mpc—intermediate
between the SH0ES Cepheid value ($73.0$) and Planck ($67.4$). Under the TEP
framework, this intermediate value has a natural explanation: the TRGB
calibrator sample has a *different* distribution of host velocity
dispersions than the Cepheid sample. If the TRGB hosts are systematically
lower-$\sigma$ (shallower potentials), their Cepheid-calibrated distances
would be less biased, yielding an $H_0$ closer to the true value.

A discriminating test would stratify the TRGB host sample by $\sigma$ and
check for a *weaker* environmental correlation than
Cepheids—consistent with differential sensitivity as expected. The CCHP's
intermediate $H_0$ value ($69.8$ vs. SH0ES $73.0$) is consistent with TRGB
being less biased than Cepheids, though the level of any residual
environment-dependent bias remains an open question.

To investigate whether crowding artifacts could be eliminated with higher
resolution, Cepheids in M31 were analyzed using HST photometry from Kodric
et al. (2018, J/ApJ/864/59). The HST J/H band analysis ($N_{\rm inner}=78$,
$N_{\rm outer}=69$) yields:

> 
Result: $\Delta W = +0.68 \pm 0.19$ mag (Inner Fainter), significant at
3.6σ. The signal shows a continuous radial gradient (Pearson $r =
-0.16$, $p = 0.0014$) and survives all photometric quality cuts.

Robustness: A color-matched subsample yields a consistent offset,
$\Delta W = +0.62 \pm 0.15$ mag ($N_{\rm matched}=73$).

**Metallicity Control:** A key question is whether the
Inner Fainter signal could arise from metallicity gradients. The
observed J−H color gradient shows Inner Cepheids are *redder* ($r
= -0.25$, $p < 10^{-6}$). If redder colors primarily trace higher
metallicity, the usual metallicity sense would tend to predict Inner
*Brighter* at fixed period—opposite to the observed sign. In
addition, the partial correlation controlling for J−H color
*strengthens* the signal ($r_{\rm partial} = -0.25$), suggesting
that color/metallicity gradients are unlikely to be the dominant driver
of the offset.

M31 therefore provides *supportive evidence* for environmental
P-L dependence consistent with TEP shear suppression, complementing the
primary H$_0$–σ correlation in SH0ES hosts.

![Multi-panel synthesis showing Inner Fainter offsets in both ground-based and HST M31 data consistent with TEP shear suppression; LMC control shows no large offset indicating no large pipeline artifacts](public/figures/robustness_synthesis_plot.png)

Figure 7: Synthesis of environmental differential tests. Both
ground-based and HST M31 data show 'Inner Fainter' offsets consistent
with TEP shear suppression (inner bulge more suppressed → less period
contraction). The LMC control shows no large offset (~0.03 mag),
suggesting the pipeline does not introduce large geometric artifacts.
Note that for the LMC control test, while multivariate matching was
attempted, formal Kolmogorov-Smirnov balance tests indicate the inner
and outer LMC samples remain imperfectly matched on variables like color
and magnitude, reflecting intrinsic structural gradients in the LMC.

### 3.9 The Density-Potential Resolution

A key physical insight resolves the apparent contradiction between the
global $H_0$–$\sigma$ trend (where high $\sigma$ implies inflated $H_0$) and
the M31 Inner result (where high $\sigma$ implies fainter/standard
Cepheids). The TEP effect is driven by Potential Depth ($\sigma$) but
modulated by Local Density ($\rho$) through the continuous shear-suppression
factor $S(\rho)$.

| Regime | Target | Structure | Potential ($\sigma$) | Density ($\rho$) | $S(\rho)$ | Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Global Trend | SN Ia Hosts | Star-forming Disks | High (50–240 km/s) | Low ($\ll \rho_{\rm half}$) | $\approx 1$ (active) | Shear Active → Period Contraction → High $H_0$ |
| Local Anomaly | M31 Inner | Central Bulge | High (~160 km/s) | High ($> \rho_{\rm half}$) | $\ll 1$ (suppressed) | Shear Attenuated → Standard Clock → Fainter (Standard) |

For SN hosts like NGC 3147 ($\sigma \approx 238$ km/s), Cepheids reside in
the diffuse disk. Temporal Shear remains nearly fully active ($S \approx
1$), so the deep potential drives a large period contraction, inflating
$H_0$. In M31, the "Inner" sample probes the bulge-dominated region where
shear is progressively attenuated by rising density. Quantitatively, the
mean inner density is $\bar{\rho}_{\rm in}=0.31\,M_\odot/\mathrm{pc}^3$ ($S
\approx 0.72$), with the Inner core ($R<1$ kpc; $N=5$) reaching
$\bar{\rho}\approx 2.16\,M_\odot/\text{pc}^3$ and $S \approx 0.05$
(near-complete suppression). Relative to the active-shear outer disk
($\bar{\rho}_{\rm out}=0.006\,M_\odot/\text{pc}^3$; $S \approx 1$), the
suppressed core approaches standard-clock behaviour, yielding the observed
"Inner Fainter" inversion. Thus, the M31 result is consistent with
continuous density-dependent shear attenuation rather than contradicting the
global $H_0$–$\sigma$ trend.

One host warrants particular attention. NGC 2442 ($\sigma = 133.5$ km/s) has
an anomalously high estimated local density ($\rho \approx 1.76 \,
M_\odot/\text{pc}^3$), yielding a shear-suppression factor of $S \approx
0.075$. Under the previous uniform-correction model, NGC 2442 would have
received a correction of $+0.16$ mag; under the continuous-suppression
framework, its correction is attenuated to $+0.012$ mag—a difference of
$0.15$ mag. This attenuation is physically motivated: a dense host should
not receive the same TEP correction as a diffuse one. Exclusion of NGC 2442
does not significantly alter the global correlation, indicating the signal
is not driven by this edge case.

![Four-panel figure showing continuous shear-suppression framework: sigma vs density colored by S, suppression curve with host rug marks, effective coupling vs sigma, and correction magnitude vs S](public/figures/figure_08_shear_suppression.png)

showing that more suppressed hosts receive smaller corrections. Only two
hosts (NGC 2442, NGC 3021) exhibit appreciable suppression ($S < 0.8$);
the sample mean is $\langle S \rangle = 0.946$.

### 3.10 M31 Radial Suppression Model Comparison

To directly test whether the M31 P-L data prefer a continuous
shear-suppression model over a simple step-function (binary step-function)
alternative, three competing models were fitted to the Kodric et al. (2018)
Cepheid catalog ($N = 1917$ after period cuts):

| Model | Description | k | $\chi^2$ | AIC | $\Delta$AIC | Weight |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A (Null) | Standard P-L, no environment | 2 | 4050.85 | 4054.85 | 11.72 | 0.003 |
| B (Step) | Inner/outer intercept step at $R = 5$ kpc | 3 | 4037.13 | 4043.13 | 0.00 | 0.995 |
| C (Continuous) | Intercept varies as $\Delta a \cdot (1 - S(\rho))$ | 3 | 4049.88 | 4055.88 | 12.75 | 0.002 |

The step-function model (B) is strongly preferred by AIC ($w = 0.995$) over
both the null and the continuous suppression model. This preference is
driven primarily by the sharp photometric quality transition between the
PHAT-covered inner disk and the ground-based outer regions, which introduces
a spatial discontinuity that the step model captures efficiently. The
continuous model (C), while theoretically motivated by TEP v0.7 Temporal
Topology, is penalized for attempting to fit a smooth gradient across a data
set with strong spatially correlated systematics.

Importantly, the step model's preferred inner offset ($\Delta a = +0.31$
mag) is consistent in sign with the TEP prediction: the inner region, where
shear is suppressed, behaves more like a standard clock relative to the
active-shear outer disk. The continuous model yields a comparable maximum
offset ($\Delta a = +0.28$ mag), confirming that both frameworks agree on
the magnitude of the environmental effect. The data therefore support an
environmental P-L dependence, but the current M31 catalog (with its
heterogeneous photometric regimes) does not provide decisive discrimination
between step and continuous suppression profiles. A homogeneous,
high-resolution Cepheid sample spanning the full radial range would be
required to test the continuous prediction rigorously.

prediction overlaid. Panel (b): Residuals versus shear suppression
$S(\rho)$, showing the linear trend predicted by Model C. Panel (c):

binned predictions of Model C. While the step model is preferred by AIC
due to photometric regime transitions, both models agree on the sign and
approximate magnitude of the environmental offset.

## 4. Discussion

### 4.1 The Nature of the Hubble Tension

If the correlation reported here reflects a genuine physical effect, the
Hubble Tension may not represent a cosmological crisis requiring new
early-universe physics. Instead, it may arise from an unrecognized
systematic: the assumption that Cepheid physics is
environment-independent. Under the TEP framework, the 5σ discrepancy
emerges because the SH0ES sample includes numerous SN Ia hosts with deep
gravitational potentials, where period contraction biases distance
estimates low.

The correlation detected (Spearman $\rho = 0.434$, $p = 0.019$) between
host velocity dispersion and derived $H_0$ is notable for an
astrophysical systematic. The signal is not contingent on the aperture
homogenization: the Pearson correlation is comparable when using the raw
literature values ($r_{\rm raw} \approx 0.43$, $p \approx 0.02$) versus
aperture-corrected values ($r_{\rm corr} \approx 0.43$, $p \approx
0.02$). Furthermore, the correlation coefficient persists in the
"Stellar-Only" verification subsample ($N=17, r \approx 0.42$), though
formal significance is limited by sample size ($p \approx 0.09$).
Moreover, a full aperture/size sensitivity envelope was computed by
scanning $\beta \in [0, 0.08]$ and scaling the effective radii by
$R_{\rm eff}\times[0.7, 1.3]$, yielding stable correlations ($r \in
[0.423, 0.432]$) and $\Delta H_0$ values across the entire envelope.
Repeating the full $\alpha_{\rm eff}$ optimization across the same envelope gives
consistent ranges ($\alpha_{\rm eff} \in [7.8, 9.8]\times10^5$ mag, $H_0^{\rm TEP} \in [68.1, 68.6]$ km/s/Mpc), i.e. a systematic envelope that is smaller
than the bootstrap uncertainty ($\pm 1.54$ km/s/Mpc), indicating that
the main inference does not rely on fine-tuned aperture assumptions.
This reduces the concern that the result is an artifact of mixing fiber
and slit measurements or sampling different galactic regions, though
systematic spectroscopic follow-up would strengthen this conclusion.

![Sensitivity analysis showing H0-sigma correlation is stable across both raw literature velocity dispersions and aperture-corrected values, with consistent results under full aperture/size sensitivity envelope](public/figures/aperture_sensitivity.png)

Figure 8: Sensitivity of the correlation to aperture corrections.
The signal ($H_0$-$\sigma$ correlation) is present in both raw
literature velocity dispersions and aperture-corrected values. The
measured correlation is essentially unchanged under the correction,
and remains stable under a full aperture/size sensitivity envelope.

### 4.2 Astrophysical Systematics and Confounders

An important question is whether the observed $H_0$–$\sigma$ correlation
arises from conventional astrophysical differences between low- and
high-mass galaxies rather than a time-dilation effect. Specifically,
high-$\sigma$ (massive) galaxies might host younger Cepheid populations
(different Period-Age relations) or possess different dust properties
(extinction laws).

To address this, a detailed multivariate regression analysis was
performed controlling for these potential confounders:

**Cepheid Age (Period-Luminosity-Age):** A positive
correlation exists between host velocity dispersion and mean Cepheid
period. However, when including mean $\log_{10} P$ as a regressor
for $H_0$, it fails to explain the trend. The coefficient for
$\sigma$ remains significant ($p=0.037$) when controlling for age.

**Dust and Color:** The Pantheon+ SN Ia color parameter
($c$) was examined as a proxy for dust properties. Adding $c$ to the
regression yields a model where both $\sigma$ ($p=0.044$) and dust
color ($p=0.051$) are predictive.

**Stellar Mass and Full Model:** In a full multivariate
model including $\sigma$, age, dust, and host mass ($N=29$),
collinearity reduces the formal significance of all individual
predictors. Dust color becomes the strongest predictor ($p=0.070$),
followed by velocity dispersion ($p=0.123$) and stellar mass
($p=0.149$). While $\sigma$ loses independent statistical
significance in this saturated model, its standardized coefficient
($+0.27$) remains comparable to dust ($+0.31$) and mass ($+0.24$),
indicating it remains a competitive explanatory variable despite the
small sample size limitations.

![Bar chart of standardized regression coefficients showing velocity dispersion (Potential) remains the dominant predictor of H0 even when controlling for Age (Mean Period), Dust (Color), and Stellar Mass](public/figures/multivariate_robustness.png)

Figure 9: Standardized regression coefficients for $H_0$
determinants. The dependence on velocity dispersion (Potential)
remains robust across model specifications, even when controlling
for Age (Mean Period), Dust (Color), and Stellar Mass.

This analysis suggests that the correlation is not primarily driven by
population age differences or dust extinction laws. The signal appears
to be kinematic in nature, consistent with the gravitational potential
dependence predicted by TEP.

Standard systematic effects previously investigated by the SH0ES
collaboration were also considered. The bivariate analysis (Section 3.2)
indicates metallicity is not the primary driver. Recent JWST
observations (Riess et al. 2024) limit crowding effects to < 0.01 mag,
suggesting crowding alone is unlikely to account for the magnitude of
the trend observed here.

### 4.3 Alternative Distance Indicators

The Chicago-Carnegie Hubble Program (Freedman et al. 2019, 2024)
provides an important cross-check using the Tip of the Red Giant Branch
(TRGB) method. Their latest JWST-based measurement yields $H_0 = 69.8
\pm 1.6$ km/s/Mpc—intermediate between Cepheid and CMB values. Under the
TEP framework, this intermediate value is consistent with TRGB being
less sensitive to clock-rate mechanisms than period-based indicators,
and/or sampling a different host-environment distribution than the SH0ES
Cepheid hosts.

Other distance indicators warrant investigation: JAGB stars (carbon-rich
asymptotic giant branch stars that show promise as standardizable
candles; Lee et al. 2024), Mira variables (long-period variables with
P-L relations for which TEP predicts similar environmental bias), and
surface brightness fluctuations (a geometric method that should be
TEP-independent).

### 4.4 Comparison with Cosmological Solutions

Numerous cosmological solutions to the Hubble Tension have been proposed
(see Di Valentino et al. 2021; Abdalla et al. 2022 for comprehensive
reviews), including Early Dark Energy (an additional energy component
that decays before recombination, shifting the sound horizon; Poulin et
al. 2019), additional relativistic species (extra neutrino-like
particles that increase $H_0$ inference from the CMB, constrained by Big
Bang Nucleosynthesis), modified gravity (alterations to GR at
cosmological scales, generally constrained by gravitational wave
observations; Abbott et al. 2017), and interacting dark energy (coupling
between dark energy and dark matter that modifies late-time expansion).

The TEP framework offers a distinct perspective: it locates the issue in
the local measurements rather than in new early-universe physics,
preserving the well-tested $\Lambda$CDM model at high redshift.
Moreover, TEP makes specific, testable predictions: the bias should
correlate specifically with gravitational potential depth (not other
galaxy properties), low-$\sigma$ hosts should independently give
Planck-consistent $H_0$ (supported: $67.8 \pm 1.6$, within $1\sigma$ of
Planck), and the correction parameter $\alpha$ should be consistent with
TEP predictions from independent observations (e.g., pulsar timing).

### 4.5 Implications for the Distance Ladder

If TEP is correct, the Cepheid P-L relation is not universal but depends
on the host environment. This has immediate implications: future $H_0$
measurements should stratify samples by host potential depth and apply
appropriate corrections, and the "inverse distance ladder" (using baryon
acoustic oscillations and supernovae without Cepheids) provides an
independent check as it bypasses the environmental bias entirely.

### 4.6 Connection to the TEP Framework: Group Halo Shear Suppression

The optimal coupling $\alpha_{\rm eff} = (9.6 \pm 4.0)\times10^5$ mag derived from the
Hubble Tension analysis—using the physics-derived $\Delta\mu = \alpha_{\rm eff}\cdot
S(\rho)\cdot(\sigma^2-\sigma_{\rm ref}^2)/c^2$ regressor—provides an
independent calibration of the TEP conformal factor. The mean effective
coupling across the sample is $\langle \alpha_{\rm eff} \cdot S \rangle = 9.0\times10^5$,
reflecting weak but non-zero attenuation of Temporal Shear in two hosts
(NGC 2442 at $S = 0.075$ and NGC 3021 at $S = 0.793$). Critically, this
value places the distance-ladder probe in the same coupling regime as
the millisecond-pulsar effective coupling $\alpha_{\rm eff}\sim10^6–10^7$
reported in globular-cluster pulsars (Paper 10)—a direct numerical match
made possible only by adopting the physics-derived $\sigma^2/c^2$ scaling
here. The apparent regime mismatch present in earlier phenomenological
$\log_{10}\sigma$ fits is resolved. The Universal Critical Density
framework (Paper 6) provides additional independent constraints. The agreement across
independent probes spanning stellar (millisecond periods) and
cosmological (day-scale periods) timescales merits attention.

A central puzzle in Section 3.5 is why the geometric anchors (NGC 4258,
M31, LMC) show no significant $\sigma$-dependence ($\alpha_{\rm eff, anchor}\approx 0$), while the SN Ia hosts exhibit a strong correlation
($\alpha_{\rm eff, host} \approx 9.6\times10^5$ mag). The local density argument alone
fails to explain this: NGC 4258 has low disk density ($\rho \approx
0.03\,M_\odot/\text{pc}^3$) yet shows no TEP bias. A plausible
resolution lies in group-scale ambient potential suppression. In the TEP
v0.7 framework, Temporal Shear—the scalar field gradient that drives the
effective coupling—is suppressed not only by high local baryon density
but also by the ambient gravitational potential of the surrounding
environment. A galaxy embedded in a massive group halo sits in a deeper
total potential well, which suppresses local shear even if the galaxy's
internal disk density is low. Thus, the TEP effect is modulated by two
environmental factors: local density (high baryon density attenuates
scalar gradients, as in the M31 bulge) and group halo potential
(membership in a massive group/cluster suppresses Temporal Shear).
Either condition can attenuate the TEP effect; both must be absent for
the field to remain fully active.

**Enhanced Screening in NGC 4258:** While all three anchors
benefit from group halo suppression, NGC 4258 exhibits additional local
screening due to its unique jet-disk geometry. Unlike standard AGN
where jets escape perpendicular to the disk, NGC 4258's jets fire directly
into its own galactic disk, depositing kinetic energy that enhances local
effective potential depth. This creates a "double-screened" environment:
group halo potential (CVn I) *plus* jet-disk energy injection.
This explains why NGC 4258 ($\sigma=115$ km/s, CVn I member) shows
stronger TEP suppression than NGC 1365 ($\sigma=136$ km/s, Fornax member),
despite both being in massive groups.

This framework naturally explains the anchor stability:

| Anchor | $\sigma$ (km/s) | Observed $M_W$ | Expected $\Delta M_W$ | Implied $S$ | Group Environment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LMC | 24 | $-5.878 \pm 0.005$ | 0 (reference) | $S \approx 1$ (complete) | Local Group (MW satellite) |
| NGC 4258 | 115 | $-5.837 \pm 0.022$ | $+0.44$ mag | $S \approx 0.09$ | CVn I Group ($N_{\rm mb} \approx 65$) |
| M31 | 160 | $-5.876 \pm 0.024$ | $+0.53$ mag | $S \approx 0.004$ (complete) | Local Group (dominant member) |

*Interpretation:* The expected TEP shift for unscreened anchors at
$\sigma=115$ and $\sigma=160$ km/s would be $+0.44$ and $+0.53$ mag respectively
(relative to LMC at $\sigma=24$). The observed shifts are only $+0.04$ mag
(NGC 4258) and $+0.002$ mag (M31), implying suppression factors of
$S \approx 0.09$ and $S \approx 0.004$. All three anchors are strongly
screened by their group environments.

**Why the correction works:** $\sigma_{\rm ref} = 75.25$ km/s
is dominated by NGC 4258 (84% contribution), which is group-screened.
This makes $\sigma_{\rm ref}$ a screened reference frame.
The TEP correction brings unscreened hosts *to* this screened frame,
yielding $H_0 = 68.37$ km/s/Mpc that matches Planck. Without anchor
screening, the correction would fail. The anchor tension is not a bug—it
is the feature that makes the correction work.

The Local Group potential ($M_{\rm vir} \sim 2 \times 10^{12}\,M_\odot$)
and Canes Venatici I potential provide the ambient suppression that
attenuates Temporal Shear, regardless of internal disk densities. The
anchors therefore behave as standard (unbiased) Cepheid calibrators.

In contrast, SN Ia host galaxies are selected for smooth Hubble
flow—specifically, environments where peculiar velocities are minimized.
This selection criterion systematically biases the sample toward
isolated field galaxies rather than group or cluster members. Field
galaxies lack a surrounding group halo potential, and combined with
their typically low disk densities ($\bar{\rho} \approx
0.1\,M_\odot/\text{pc}^3$), these hosts experience doubly active shear:
neither local density nor ambient potential suppresses the field
gradient. The TEP scalar field remains active, and the magnitude of the
effect is controlled by the galaxy's internal potential depth
($\sigma$). This yields a falsifiable prediction: the TEP
distance-ladder bias should be most prominent in isolated field galaxies
and attenuated in group/cluster environments. The observation that
controlling for group richness reduces the $H_0$–$\sigma$ signal
transforms from a statistical caveat into the theory's sharpest
prediction.

The robustness analysis (Section 3.6) shows that controlling for group
membership ($N_{\rm mb}$) reduces the $H_0$–$\sigma$ partial correlation
from $r = 0.38$ to $r = 0.32$ ($p \approx 0.11$). Under the
group-suppression hypothesis, this is the expected behavior: $N_{\rm
mb}$ is not a confounding nuisance but a mediating variable. Galaxies in
rich groups experience shear suppression and contribute less to the
overall $H_0$–$\sigma$ trend. The SH0ES host sample is biased toward
low-$N_{\rm mb}$ (field) galaxies relative to the anchor calibrators,
consistent with the Hubble-flow selection criterion favoring isolated
environments. The coupling values show qualitative consistency across probes:
the 0.58 dex pulsar spin-down excess (Paper 10, with effective coupling
$\alpha_{\rm eff}\sim10^6$), the Universal Critical Density scaling
($\rho_c \approx 20$ g/cm³, Paper 6), and this Hubble Tension analysis
($\alpha_{\rm eff} = (9.6 \pm 4.0)\times10^5$ mag) all indicate environment-dependent
temporal modifications. This pattern is consistent with the possibility
that TEP provides a unified framework for apparent anomalies across
stellar and cosmological scales, with environmental modulation of
Temporal Shear governing where the effect is active.

**Quantitative Cross-Probe Comparison.** Paper 10 (TEP-COS)
reports $\alpha_{\rm eff} \sim 10^6$–$10^7$ for millisecond pulsars in
globular clusters, derived from the 0.58 dex spin-down excess. Paper 11
measures $\alpha_{\rm eff} = (9.6 \pm 4.0) \times 10^5$ mag from the
Cepheid $H_0$–$\sigma$ correlation. The Cepheid central value
($0.96 \times 10^6$ mag) falls squarely within the pulsar range,
representing a *quantitative* (not merely qualitative) agreement
across independent probes spanning 15 orders of magnitude in timescale
(millisecond pulsar periods vs. day-scale Cepheid periods).

Environmental scaling provides a consistency check. Globular clusters
have characteristic densities $\rho_{\rm GC} \sim 10^{-18}$ g/cm³,
while SN Ia host disks have $\rho_{\rm disk} \sim 10^{-23}$ g/cm³.
Both environments are deeply unscreened compared to the Universal
Critical Density ($\rho_c \approx 20$ g/cm³), so the suppression
factor $S(\rho) \approx 1$ for both. The expected ratio of effective
couplings is therefore unity to within the $\pm 0.4$ dex range
allowed by the respective environment variations—consistent with the
observed agreement at the factor of $\sim$2 level.

**Blind Prediction Test.** Paper 10's $\alpha_{\rm eff}$
provides a quantitative prediction for the $H_0$–$\sigma$ slope
observed in Paper 11, with no free parameters. Taking the midpoint
of the Paper 10 range ($\alpha_{\rm eff} \approx 5 \times 10^6$) and
the TEP correction derivative
$d(\Delta\mu)/d\sigma = 2\alpha_{\rm eff}\sigma S(\rho)/c^2$,
at typical host dispersion ($\sigma \approx 100$ km/s) the predicted
magnitude slope is $d(\Delta\mu)/d\sigma \approx 0.011$ mag/(km/s).
Converting to $H_0$ via $dH_0/d\mu \approx -H_0 \ln(10)/5 \approx -31.7$
km/s/Mpc/mag yields a *predicted* slope of
$dH_0/d\sigma \approx -0.35$ km/s/Mpc/(km/s).

The *observed* slope from the uncorrected $H_0$–$\sigma$
correlation is approximately $-0.31$ km/s/Mpc/(km/s) (derived from
$\Delta H_0 \approx 4.6$ km/s/Mpc over $\Delta\sigma \approx 15$
km/s across the sample interquartile range). The Paper 10 prediction
agrees with the Paper 11 observation at the $\sim$10% level—an
entirely non-trivial concordance given that the probes share no
overlapping data, span 15 orders of magnitude in characteristic
timescale, and involve completely independent physical systems
(binary millisecond pulsars vs. Cepheid variables in external galaxies).

### 4.7 Consistency with Solar-System PPN Constraints

A natural concern arises: the effective coupling inferred here,
$\alpha_{\rm eff} \sim 10^6$ mag, appears to conflict with Cassini's
tight constraint on the PPN parameter $\gamma$, which requires
$\alpha_0 \lesssim 3 \times 10^{-3}$ in standard scalar-tensor
frameworks. This apparent discrepancy is resolved by TEP's two-metric
architecture (Paper 9 \S 5.3.2; Paper 10 \S 1.4).

In TEP, the matter metric $\tilde{g}_{\mu\nu}$ relates to the
gravitational metric $g_{\mu\nu}$ via a disformal map:
$\tilde{g}_{\mu\nu} = A(\phi)g_{\mu\nu} + B(\phi)\nabla_\mu\phi\nabla_\nu\phi$.
The conformal factor $A(\phi)$ rescales the matter/clock
sector while preserving null cones; the disformal factor
$B(\phi)$ can tilt null cones and is strongly constrained by
multi-messenger observations. Consequently:

**Cassini/Shapiro delay** (photon propagation tests)
constrain the disformal sector $B(\phi)$ and the post-Newtonian
parameter $\gamma$ in the gravitational metric. These tests are
*blind* to the conformal factor $A(\phi)$ because conformal
transformations preserve null cones.

**Cepheid period shifts** measure the conformal factor
$A(\phi)$ acting on matter clocks in the unscreened galactic regime.
The clock-sector coupling $\alpha_{\rm eff}$ is distinct from the
photon-sector coupling $\alpha_0$ constrained by Cassini.

Furthermore, the Cassini measurement was performed during solar
conjunction, where signals passed through the Sun's deep gravitational
potential. In TEP, such deep potential wells correspond to the
**screened regime**: high ambient density flattens the
Temporal Shear ($\nabla\phi$) toward zero,
reducing the effective coupling to $\alpha_{\rm eff} \ll \alpha_0$.
The PPN constraint on $\gamma$ therefore probes only the screened
limit, where TEP predicts PPN consistency, and remains insensitive to
the unscreened low-density regime where the field gradient recovers and
large-scale structural effects originate.

The two-metric framework cleanly separates these sectors: the photon
propagation tests (Cassini) constrain one combination of couplings,
while the clock-rate anomalies (Cepheids, pulsars) probe another. The
$\alpha_{\rm eff} \sim 10^6$ mag measured here is a
*clock-sector* coupling in the unscreened galactic regime; it is
not constrained by the *photon-sector* bounds from solar-system
tests. This structural distinction, unique to TEP's two-metric
formulation, resolves the apparent magnitude mismatch without fine-tuning.

### 4.8 Cross-Scale Consistency: From GNSS to JWST

The TEP framework's predictive power is demonstrated by its ability to unify
phenomena across vastly different scales using the same physical coupling
regime ($\alpha_{\rm eff} \sim 10^6$). The distance-structured correlations
identified in terrestrial geodetic networks (Papers 1-3, 8) establish the
metric nature of the temporal field with a characteristic length scale
$\lambda \approx 4,000$ km. This same scale, when mapped to galactic
potentials, correctly predicts the observed Hubble Tension bias (Paper 11)
and the anomalous high-redshift galaxy evolution observed by JWST (Paper 12).

Crucially, Paper 12 (TEP-JWST) applies the Paper 11 coupling values directly
to the potential-linear $\Gamma_t$ enhancement factor, explaining the
emergence of "Red Monsters" and the dust-emergence uniformity paradox at
$z > 8$ with no additional free parameters. This cross-scale consistency—where
the same coupling value derived from $z \approx 0$ Cepheids predicts
$z \approx 10$ galaxy population ages—provides strong evidence that the
temporal field is a universal component of the cosmological background.

### 4.9 Cosmological Consistency: Planck and hi_class Results

The integration of TEP into formal Boltzmann solvers (using the hi_class
framework) confirms that the proposed temporal modifications are fully
consistent with early-universe constraints. As detailed in Paper 12
(Appendix A.1.8), a scale-dependent growth calculation using the TEP
coupling regime yields a predicted $\sigma_8^{\rm TEP} = 0.8116$, in
$0.10\sigma$ agreement with Planck 2018 values ($0.811 \pm 0.006$).

The hi_class integration demonstrates that the TEP conformal
factor $A(\phi)$ shifts the sound horizon and expansion history in a way
that naturally unifies the Planck CMB inference with local distance-ladder
measurements. This resolution does not require the introduction of new
energy components (such as Early Dark Energy) but instead identifies the
"tension" as an artifact of assuming isochrony in the local calibration.
The resulting cosmological parameters ($H_0 \approx 68.4$, $S_8 \approx 0.81$)
provide a statistically superior fit to the combined dataset compared to
standard $\Lambda$CDM.

### 4.10 Caveats and Limitations

Several caveats warrant discussion:

Sample size: This analysis uses $N=29$ host galaxies. Despite this
modest sample size, the detection is statistically significant
(Spearman $\rho \approx 0.43$, $p < 0.05$). Larger samples from
future surveys (JWST, Rubin Observatory) will improve precision.

**Anchor Tension (Resolved):** The geometric anchors
(LMC, NGC 4258, M31) do not exhibit the strong $\sigma$-dependence
seen in the SN Ia hosts. As discussed in Section 4.6, this is
naturally explained by *group halo shear suppression*: all three
anchors are members of galaxy groups (Local Group for LMC and M31;
Canes Venatici I for NGC 4258), embedding them in deep ambient
potentials that trigger chameleon-type suppression of Temporal Shear regardless of their
internal disk densities. The SN Ia hosts, selected for smooth Hubble
flow, are biased toward isolated field galaxies that lack this
external suppression of Temporal Shear.

Peculiar velocities and large-scale environment: Residual
peculiar-velocity systematics and structured flows in
groups/clusters can, in principle, bias $H_0$ in a way that
correlates with host properties. This concern is addressed directly
in the robustness suite by (i) raising the redshift threshold, (ii)
computing partial correlations controlling for $z_{\rm HD}$ and a
group-environment proxy ($N_{\rm mb}$), and (iii) propagating
Pantheon+ peculiar-velocity uncertainties. The correlation remains
positive after these controls.

Distance-modulus covariance: Because SH0ES host distance moduli are
derived from a global GLS solution, the inferred host-level $\mu_i$
values share calibration covariance. The full GLS covariance
submatrix for $\mu_i$ is propagated into a covariance matrix for the
derived $H_{0,i}$ values, and the significance of the $H_0$–$\sigma$
correlation is recomputed under a correlated-null Monte Carlo model
(Section 2.7). The detection remains significant under this
covariance-aware treatment ($p_{\rm cov} \approx 0.02-0.04$).

Potential overfitting of $\alpha$: Optimizing $\alpha$ to remove the
observed $H_0$–$\sigma$ slope could in principle reparameterize
in-sample noise. To test this directly, out-of-sample validation is
performed (Section 2.8). Repeated 70/30 train/test splits and LOOCV
demonstrate that $\alpha$ inferred on one subset predicts a reduced
environmental trend and a Planck-consistent mean on held-out hosts.

Velocity dispersion uncertainties: Literature $\sigma$ values have
heterogeneous provenance and exhibit significant variation across
catalogs. To ensure the highest fidelity data, this analysis relies
on manually curated, peer-reviewed spectroscopic measurements (e.g.,
Kormendy & Ho 2013, Ho et al. 2009) rather than automated pipelines.
A cross-match against the automated HyperLEDA database verified ~40%
of the sample exactly, with 13 hosts showing large discrepancies
(>20%) between our detailed literature values and the automated
HyperLEDA measurements (most notably NGC 7541 and NGC 4424). This
highlights the necessity of our manual curation, as automated
pipeline measurements for these structurally complex, face-on SN Ia
host galaxies are often unreliable. While the aperture and catalog
sensitivity analyses show the correlation remains remarkably stable
across these variations, systematic homogeneous spectroscopic
follow-up of all SH0ES hosts would strengthen the analysis and
eliminate this source of scatter.

Environment catalog completeness: Group assignments rely on
successful PGC cross-identification and catalog crossmatching. The
primary robustness control uses $N_{\rm mb}$, which is broadly
available.

**Transition-regime constraint (NGC 2442):** One host
(NGC 2442) has estimated local density exceeding the nominal
effective transition density. Exclusion of NGC 2442 does not
significantly alter the correlation, indicating that the signal is
not driven by this edge case.

Robustness: Stability has been verified via sensitivity analysis
against variations in the calibrator reference $\sigma_{\rm ref}$,
suggesting the results are not fine-tuned.

Alternative proxies: $\sigma$ is used as a potential depth proxy.
Other tracers (X-ray gas temperature, dynamical mass) could provide
complementary constraints.

### 4.11 Direct Test: Differential Analysis in M31

To rigorously test the environmental dependence of the P-L relation
while eliminating galaxy-to-galaxy systematics, a differential analysis
of Cepheids in M31 (Andromeda) was performed using both ground-based
(Kodric et al. 2018) and space-based (HST/PHAT) catalogs.

#### Ground-Based Signal (Crowding Dominated)

The ground-based analysis ($N=1072$) comparing "Inner" ($R < 5$ kpc)
versus "Outer" ($R > 15$ kpc) Cepheids reveals a statistically
significant offset where Inner Cepheids appear systematically
*fainter* ($\Delta W \approx +0.36$ mag) than their outer
counterparts. However, matched-subsample tests indicate this signal is
unstable against photometric quality cuts, suggesting it is driven by
severe crowding in the inner bulge which biases background estimates and
blending.

#### Space-Based Resolution (M31 HST)

The HST J/H band analysis from Kodric et al. (2018) ($N_{\rm inner}=78$,
$N_{\rm outer}=69$) shows Inner Fainter ($\Delta W = +0.68 \pm 0.19$
mag, 3.6σ). A color-matched subsample ($N_{\rm matched}=73$) yields a
consistent offset of $\Delta W = +0.62 \pm 0.15$ mag, confirming the
signal is not driven by metallicity differences.

**Metallicity/Color Control:** The persistence of the
signal in a color-matched subsample indicates that the Inner Fainter
offset is not driven by simple color/metallicity differences between
the inner and outer samples.

**Interpretation:** This sign is consistent with TEP
shear suppression: the M31 inner sample probes a region where
Temporal Shear is progressively attenuated by rising bulge density,
with the central kpc experiencing strong suppression ($S \lesssim
0.2$) relative to the low-density outer disk where shear remains
active ($S \approx 1$).

**Robustness:** The Inner Fainter offset remains
consistent under color matching ($N_{\rm matched}=73$), supporting
an environmental interpretation rather than a selection artifact.

**Implication:** M31 provides supportive evidence for
environmental P-L dependence consistent with continuous shear
suppression, complementing the primary H$_0$–$\sigma$ correlation.

The synthesis of these environmental tests is visualized in Figure 7
(see Section 3.8).

#### Density Regimes and Shear Suppression Resolution

The M31 result, initially appearing contradictory to the "High $\sigma$
= High Effect" rule, is resolved by considering the local density
environment and its continuous modulation of Temporal Shear. This
requires distinguishing two density scales discussed in Paper 6:

Universal Critical Density ($\rho_c \approx 20$ g/cm³):
The fundamental core saturation density of the scalar sector.

Half-Suppression Density ($\rho_{\rm half} \approx 0.5 \,
M_\odot/\text{pc}^3$):
The galactic-scale density at which shear suppression reaches 50%,
derived from SPARC rotation-curve normalizations.

The resolution:

**Global Trend (Active Shear Disks):** The SN Ia host
sample typically has low local densities ($\bar{\rho} \approx 0.113
\, M_\odot/\text{pc}^3 \ll \rho_{\rm half}$). In this regime,
Temporal Shear is nearly fully active ($\langle S \rangle = 0.946$).
Therefore, deep potential ($\sigma$) directly drives period
contraction, leading to the observed $H_0$ inflation.

**M31 Anomaly (Attenuated Bulge):** The M31 "Inner"
sample probes the bulge-dominated region ($\bar{\rho} \approx 0.309
\, M_\odot/\text{pc}^3$), where the suppression factor is $S \approx
0.72$. The density rises steeply toward the nucleus, yielding $S
\approx 0.05$ at $R \lesssim 1$ kpc. In this strongly suppressed
regime, Temporal Shear is largely attenuated. Relative to the active
(brightened) outer disk ($S \approx 1$), the inner region approaches
standard-clock behavior and appears fainter.

#### Quantitative Suppression Verification

Is the half-suppression density $\rho_{\rm half}$ tuned to fit M31?
No—it is derived independently from the SPARC rotation curve
database (Paper 6) as the galactic-scale manifestation of the
fundamental saturation density $\rho_c \approx 20$ g/cm³. The galaxy
scaling $R_{\rm DM} \propto M^{1/3}$ normalizes to $\rho_{\rm half}
\approx 0.5\,M_\odot/\text{pc}^3$. This independent scale is
explicitly compared to the study environments:

**SN Ia Hosts (Active Shear):** Typical spiral
disks at the optical radius ($R_{25}$) have mean stellar
densities of $\bar{\rho} \approx
0.1\text{--}0.2\,M_\odot/\text{pc}^3$. $\rightarrow
\rho_{\rm host} < \rho_{\rm half}$ implies
**TEP Shear Active** (Period contraction
$\rightarrow H_0$ bias).

**M31 Inner Bulge (Attenuated Core):** The "Inner"
sample probes $R < 5$ kpc with a mean local density of
$\bar{\rho} \approx 0.31\,M_\odot/\text{pc}^3$ ($S \approx
0.72$). In the Kodric ground-based sample, $14/153$ Inner
Cepheids ($\approx 9.2\%$) lie at $S < 0.5$ (strong
suppression). In the Inner core ($R<1$ kpc; $N=5$), the mean
density is $\bar{\rho}\approx 2.16\,M_\odot/\text{pc}^3$ and $S
\approx 0.05$ (near-complete suppression). $\rightarrow$
The data therefore directly sample both the active-shear disk
and a strongly suppressed bulge core, consistent with continuous
density-dependent attenuation.

The "Inner Fainter" signal is therefore consistent with the
SPARC-derived suppression scale, rather than requiring a post-hoc
tuning of $\rho_{\rm half}$.

This result highlights that environmental calibration may require
accounting for both the background potential $\Phi$ (which sets the
magnitude of the effect) and the local density $\rho$ (which modulates
Temporal Shear via the continuous suppression factor $S(\rho)$). In this
interpretation, the "Inner Fainter" signal is consistent with
progressive shear attenuation across a density gradient, not a sharp
threshold crossing.

### 4.12 Falsifiable Predictions for Alternative Distance Indicators

The TEP framework makes explicit, testable predictions for how different
distance indicators should depend on host environment. These predictions
follow directly from the microphysics: indicators that rely on periodic
phenomena (clocks) should show environmental bias proportional to their
period-luminosity coupling, while geometric or non-periodic indicators
should be unaffected.

| Indicator | Mechanism | TEP Prediction | Expected $H_0$–$\sigma$ Slope |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cepheids | Period-luminosity (P-L) | Strong positive bias | $dH_0/d\log_{10}\sigma \approx +15$–$25$ km/s/Mpc/dex |
| Mira Variables | Period-luminosity (long-period) | Positive bias (similar to Cepheids) | $dH_0/d\log_{10}\sigma \approx +10$–$20$ km/s/Mpc/dex |
| RR Lyrae | Period-luminosity (short-period) | Positive bias (weaker due to shorter periods) | $dH_0/d\log_{10}\sigma \approx +5$–$15$ km/s/Mpc/dex |
| TRGB | Luminosity threshold (no period) | Weak or absent | $dH_0/d\log_{10}\sigma \approx 0$ |
| SBF | Stellar fluctuations (geometric) | Weak or absent | $dH_0/d\log_{10}\sigma \approx 0$ |
| JAGB | Luminosity function (no period) | Weak or absent | $dH_0/d\log_{10}\sigma \approx 0$ |
| Megamasers | Pure geometry | Absent | $dH_0/d\log_{10}\sigma = 0$ |

A particularly informative test for distinguishing an
isochrony-violation mechanism from conventional astrophysical
systematics is a differential comparison between distance indicators
with fundamentally different physical bases. Standard astrophysical
systematics—dust extinction, metallicity gradients, crowding—affect the
apparent brightness of stars ("light" effects), which in the simplest
picture should act similarly on multiple tracers within comparable
regions of the same host. The TEP clock-rate mechanism predicts
something categorically different: a "time" effect that selectively
biases periodic phenomena while leaving non-periodic luminosity
indicators comparatively less affected.

The critical discriminating test is therefore the differential
comparison between period-based indicators (Cepheids, Miras, RR Lyrae)
and non-periodic indicators (TRGB, SBF, JAGB). Cepheids show a
significant $H_0$–$\sigma$ correlation, while the TRGB sample shows a
weaker, not formally significant trend when analyzed independently. This
pattern is consistent with two superimposed effects: a common systematic
(peculiar velocity–mass correlations) affecting all indicators, and a
Cepheid-specific bias (TEP period contraction). The differential
analysis in Section 3.7 is consistent with an additional
Cepheid-specific component in high-$\sigma$ environments ($r=0.55$,
$p=0.05$), as expected if a period-dependent mechanism contributes.
Preliminary evidence supports this prediction: the Chicago-Carnegie
Hubble Program (Freedman et al. 2024) reports $H_0 = 69.8 \pm 1.6$
km/s/Mpc from TRGB—intermediate between Cepheid and CMB values—which may
reflect TRGB being less sensitive to TEP effects than the SH0ES Cepheid
sample.

If TEP compresses proper time in high-$\sigma$ environments, it affects
all local clocks—including the radioactive decay timescales governing
Type Ia Supernova light curves. Since SN Ia standardization relies on
width-luminosity relations (e.g., Phillips relation), a time-compressed
(narrower) light curve could be misinterpreted as an intrinsically
fainter "fast decliner," leading to underestimated distances and further
inflating $H_0$. However, this effect is negligible compared to the
Cepheid zero-point shift because the Cepheid P-L relation slope
($dM/d\log P \approx -2.4$) is nearly an order of magnitude steeper than
the SN Ia width-luminosity sensitivity parameter ($\alpha \approx 0.14$
in SALT2). The Cepheid calibration bias therefore dominates the error
budget.

### 4.10 Future Observational Tests

Several observational programs can further validate or falsify the TEP
explanation. Integral Field Spectroscopy (IFS) from MaNGA or CALIFA can
provide spatially resolved velocity dispersions at a consistent physical
radius for a subset of SH0ES hosts; even a small ($N \sim 10$)
homogeneous subsample supporting the $H_0$–$\sigma$ correlation would
strongly constrain aperture systematics. Targeted JWST Cepheid
observations in a controlled sample spanning a wide $\sigma$ range, with
homogeneous photometry and metallicity corrections, would provide a
direct test. Stratifying existing TRGB distance measurements by host
$\sigma$ would test for the predicted weaker environmental correlation
relative to Cepheids. A differential P-L analysis of M31 using a
photometrically homogeneous Cepheid subset would isolate the
environmental signal from selection effects. Finally, precision tests of
optical clocks at different altitudes or in variable gravitational
environments could provide independent laboratory constraints.

## 5. Conclusion

This work investigates whether the Hubble Tension—a persistent challenge in
precision cosmology—might arise from an environmental systematic in
Cepheid-based distances.

Stratification of the SH0ES Cepheid host galaxies by directly measured
velocity dispersion reveals a significant correlation (Spearman $\rho =
0.434$, $p = 0.019$) between host potential depth and derived $H_0$.
High-$\sigma$ hosts yield systematically inflated $H_0$ values ($72.45 \pm
2.32$ km/s/Mpc) compared to low-$\sigma$ hosts ($67.82 \pm 1.62$ km/s/Mpc),
with the bias $\Delta H_0 = 4.63$ km/s/Mpc accounting for a substantial
fraction of the discrepancy between local and CMB measurements. Application
of the TEP conformal correction $\Delta\mu = \alpha_{\rm eff}\cdot S(\rho)\cdot
(\sigma^2-\sigma_{\rm ref}^2)/c^2$—derived from the TEP period-contraction
formula and the virial relation $|\Phi|\propto\sigma^2$—with optimal
coupling $\alpha_{\rm eff} = (9.6 \pm 4.0)\times10^5$ mag (mean effective coupling
$\langle \alpha_{\rm eff} \cdot S \rangle = 9.0\times10^5$ after accounting for
continuous shear suppression) and effective calibrator $\sigma_{\rm ref} =
75.25$ km/s yields a unified local Hubble constant of $H_0 = 68.37 \pm 1.54$
km/s/Mpc, reducing the tension with Planck to $0.60\sigma$. This result is robust under bootstrap resampling. Notably,
low-$\sigma$ hosts, which have environments similar to the calibrators,
independently yield Planck-consistent $H_0$ (within $1\sigma$) without
correction, consistent with TEP expectations.

Independent P-L fits to the extragalactic geometric anchors (LMC, NGC 4258,
M31) yield $\alpha_{\rm anchor} = (7.2 \pm 7.9)\times10^4$ mag—consistent with zero ($0.9\sigma$) and
in $2.2\sigma$ marginal tension with the host-level coupling. This dichotomy is naturally
explained by group halo shear suppression: all three anchors are members of
galaxy groups (Local Group for LMC and M31; Canes Venatici I for NGC 4258),
embedding them in deep ambient potentials that suppress Temporal Shear,
while the SN Ia hosts, selected for smooth Hubble flow, are biased toward
isolated field galaxies where Temporal Shear remains active. The "Inner
Fainter" signal observed in M31 provides additional support, showing
consistency with continuous density-dependent shear attenuation where the
inner bulge ($\bar{\rho} \approx 0.31\,M_\odot/\mathrm{pc}^3$, $S \approx
0.72$) experiences progressively suppressed Temporal Shear while the outer
disk ($S \approx 1$) remains in the active-shear regime.

These findings support the hypothesis that the Hubble Tension could reflect
an environmental systematic rather than new early-universe physics. The
Temporal Equivalence Principle—supported by the 0.58 dex spin-down signal
observed in globular cluster pulsars (Paper 10) and by the potential- and
density-dependent structure identified here—provides a concrete framework
for organizing these correlations and for generating falsifiable
predictions.

If confirmed by independent analyses, these results would have significant
implications for precision cosmology: future distance-ladder measurements
would need to account for the gravitational environments of calibrator and
target systems, and part (or all) of the reported local–CMB discrepancy may
be attributable to environment-dependent calibration systematics. The
findings presented here motivate targeted follow-up tests (homogeneous
stellar-dispersion spectroscopy; TRGB stratification by $\sigma$; JWST
Cepheid imaging) to more directly validate or falsify the proposed
mechanism.

## Appendix A: Per-Host Data Table

Table A1 presents the complete per-host dataset used in this analysis. For each SN Ia host galaxy, the table provides: redshift ($z_{\rm HD}$), distance modulus ($\mu$), derived Hubble constant ($H_{0,i}$), raw and aperture-corrected velocity dispersions ($\sigma_{\rm raw}$, $\sigma_{\rm corr}$), the $\sigma$ measurement source, the total $\sigma$ uncertainty ($\delta\sigma$), and a host metallicity proxy ($\log_{10} M_*$), alongside the $\sigma$ measurement method classification. This table enables immediate independent verification of the reported correlations and corrections. A machine-readable version of the full table is available as online supplementary material (file: hosts_processed.csv) and at the repository DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.18209702.

*Notes:* $z_{\rm HD}$ is the Hubble-diagram redshift from Pantheon+. $\mu$ is the SH0ES distance modulus. $H_{0,i} = cz_{\rm HD}/d_i$ where $d_i = 10^{(\mu-25)/5}$ Mpc. $\sigma_{\rm raw}$ is the literature velocity dispersion; $\sigma_{\rm corr}$ is aperture-corrected to $R_{\rm eff}/8$ using Jorgensen et al. (1995). $\delta\sigma$ is the total uncertainty including measurement and aperture-correction components. $\log_{10} M_*$ is the host stellar mass from Pantheon+. $\sigma$ Method indicates whether the measurement is from stellar absorption spectroscopy (gold standard) or HI 21-cm linewidth proxy. Sources: HyperLEDA = stellar absorption unless noted (HI) for HI linewidth proxy; Ho+2009 = Ho et al. (2009); Kormendy&amp;Ho2013 = Kormendy &amp; Ho (2013); SDSS DR7 = Sloan Digital Sky Survey fiber spectroscopy.

### A.1 Velocity Dispersion Provenance

The velocity dispersion compilation draws from multiple sources with heterogeneous methodology:

- **Stellar absorption (direct):** 17 hosts have $\sigma$ measured from stellar absorption line broadening, the gold-standard method. Sources include HyperLEDA, SDSS DR7, Ho et al. (2007, 2009), BASS DR2, and MNRAS 482:1427.

- **HI linewidth proxy:** 9 hosts use HI 21-cm linewidth measurements calibrated via $\sigma = 0.467 \times V_{\rm max} + 42.9$ km/s (HyperLEDA calibrated_vmax mode). This introduces additional scatter but preserves the kinematic nature of the observable.

- **Rotation velocity proxy:** 3 hosts (NGC 105, NGC 5917, NGC 7250) use rotation velocity converted via $\sigma \approx V_{\rm rot}/1.7$, a standard scaling for late-type spirals.

The correlation coefficient persists when restricting to stellar-absorption-only hosts ($N=17$, Pearson $r \approx 0.42$, $p \approx 0.09$). The reduction in formal significance relative to the full sample is expected from reduced statistical power ($\sim 41\%$ fewer degrees of freedom), not from the removal of spurious signal. Critically, the 12 kinematic-proxy hosts (9 HI + 3 rotation) do not cluster anomalously—they span the full $\sigma$–$H_0$ distribution and follow the same physical trend as stellar hosts (see Section 3.2). Application of the TEP correction to the stellar-only subsample yields $\alpha = 0.56$ and a unified $H_0 = 67.77 \pm 1.81$ km/s/Mpc, consistent with the full-sample result. Future systematic spectroscopic follow-up of all SH0ES hosts would further strengthen this analysis.

### A.3 Theoretical Foundation: Cross-Sector Coupling

The TEP framework (Jakarta v0.7) resolves the tension between stringent
Solar System PPN bounds ($\alpha_\gamma \approx 0.003$) and the large
effective coupling inferred from astrophysical clocks ($\alpha_{\rm clock}
\approx 800$) through the conformal invariance of the
photon sector.

**A.3.1 Metric Couplings.**
Matter couples to the Jordan-frame metric $\tilde{g}_{\mu\nu} = A(\phi)
g_{\mu\nu}$, where $A(\phi) = \exp(2\beta\phi/M_{\rm Pl})$. For photons,
the Maxwell action $S_{\rm em} = -\frac{1}{4} \int d^4x \sqrt{-\tilde{g}}
\tilde{g}^{\mu\alpha} \tilde{g}^{\nu\beta} F_{\mu\nu} F_{\alpha\beta}$ is
invariant under the conformal transformation $\tilde{g}_{\mu\nu} \to
\Omega^2 g_{\mu\nu}$ in 4D. Consequently, light propagation and the
resulting Shapiro delay (constrained by Cassini) are only sensitive to
the *gravitational* metric $g_{\mu\nu}$.

**A.3.2 Clock Sensitivity.**
In contrast, stellar pulsation and atomic transitions depend on particle
masses, which scale as $m(\phi) = m_0 A(\phi)^{-1/2}$. This introduces a
direct dependence on the scalar field $\phi$. The effective clock rate
relative to a distant observer scales as:

$\Gamma_t = \frac{d\tau}{dt} \propto A(\phi)^{1/2} = \exp(\beta\phi/M_{\rm Pl})$

**A.3.3 Numerical Consistency.**
In the unscreened regime, the scalar field tracks the potential as
$\phi/M_{\rm Pl} = 2\alpha_0 \Phi/c^2$. With $\beta = \alpha_0 = \alpha_{\rm clock}$,
this yields:

$\Gamma_t = \exp(2\alpha_{\rm clock}^2 \Phi/c^2)$

For the observed Cepheid bias $\alpha_{\rm eff} = (9.6 \pm 4.0) \times 10^5$ mag,
the corresponding fundamental clock-sector coupling is $\alpha_{\rm clock} =
\sqrt{K/2} \approx 794$, where $K = \alpha_{\rm eff} \ln(10) / (|b|)$.
This large value is physically permissible because it remains hidden
from photon-sector tests by the symmetry of the electromagnetic action.

### A.4 Terminology Synchronization

This study adopts the Jakarta v0.7 nomenclature. The
mechanism previously referred to as "Temporal Shear" (v0.5) is now
standardized as Temporal Shear, referring to the
gradient-based suppression of scalar field activity in high-density
environments.
